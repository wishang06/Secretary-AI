[Andy Shang] 23:58:51
Give me a sec… Okay, transcript started.

[Andy Shang] 23:58:56
Yep. So…

[Andy Shang] 23:58:58
Today, this video is…

[Andy Shang] 23:59:00
Uh, just for the sake of the AI, we'll call it an…

[Andy Shang] 23:59:03
Full committee meeting, uh, but we will, at the start, only show it to execs.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:08
Okay, and um… the purpose of meeting is to introduce a new project me and Michael have been working on.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:16
Uh, also is the secretary AI.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:18
Which is a… how do I put this? A…

[Andy Shang] 23:59:24
a AI assistant in, currently, Discord, or maybe Messenger in the future.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:29
Oh, taking all of this.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:31
set a task for Michael due at the end of next week.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:35
to create a messenger version of our product.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:39
Okay, I will come back to this later.

[Andy Shang] 23:59:41
And so currently, this product…

[Andy Shang] 23:59:44
acts as a…

[Andy Shang] 23:59:46
a bot that you can talk to

[Andy Shang] 23:59:49
directly through this platform, either Discord or Messenger. And then through this bot, you can learn about your daily tasks, the information about members in the society, as well as

[Andy Shang] 00:00:01
managing meetings.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:02
And currently, right now, I'll share my screen to show some of the background

[Andy Shang] 00:00:08
information before we get started.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:13
Okay, so I'm currently sharing my screen, and…

[Andy Shang] 00:00:17
Okay, so this is the main background database bit of our little project.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:22
This itself is called the ERD, the Entity Relationship Diagram, which is what

[Andy Shang] 00:00:27
Uh, data scientists use to basically manage the backend of some projects data-wise.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:33
And as you can see here, there's a lot of tables.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:36
But, in essence, there's only 4 main tables, and the rest are linkage tables.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:41
So, as you can see, committee table, that's the main one.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:44
And in each main table, there's…

[Andy Shang] 00:00:47
uh, the ID, the name, and then some other sub-information which we can be used to extract.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:52
If we want to know about it.

[Andy Shang] 00:00:55
And the linking tables only take the IDs of each of the big tables, which makes it easier to create relationships between these information and

[Andy Shang] 00:01:05
Uh, data points.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:07
And also, just as a side note, it is a habit, I guess, of data scientists to include ingestion timestamp in every single table.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:15
As it basically just shows when it was ingested into the system, as well as

[Andy Shang] 00:01:21
simultaneously saying when the actual meeting, when the member joined, or when did a project start taking place.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:27
Yep. And then…

[Andy Shang] 00:01:30
Okay, just a quick look at the information table. Currently, it's all just dummy data. I generated, well, Gemini helped me generate oldestamy data. The only real people here are Andy, Michael, myself, and Michael, of course.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:41
I had a few other people. And the current format, we are following the business analytics society

[Andy Shang] 00:01:46
subcommittee format, Executive Director Officer.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:50
that all works. And then projects, sample projects, except for number 4, which you can see here, is the actual Secretary AI.

[Andy Shang] 00:01:58
And what you may not have noticed is that I already started the transcript in this current meeting.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:04
So, in a moment, I'm gonna…

[Andy Shang] 00:02:07
basically save this transcript, I run it through our entire pipeline, our entire process, where it goes from an online meeting directly in seconds,

[Andy Shang] 00:02:15
into ingest it fully into our database with linkage-free products,

[Andy Shang] 00:02:19
tasks and topics.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:21
Okay, and uh… right now, I will show the Discord.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:27
Uh, yeah, Michael, not if you can see my Discord, please.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:31
Okay, okay, that's all good.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:33
And, uh, so far, our Discord bot is called Encore.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:37
Uh, don't mind the profile picture, just, uh…

[Andy Shang] 00:02:40
demo phase, yep.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:44
And this is connected directly to our server, which has been set up by Michael, a online server that runs 24-7. So, whenever a member or someone wants to communicate with it, it will always be there, ready to go.

[Andy Shang] 00:02:55
And yes, business analytics to society already ingested it with our…

[Andy Shang] 00:02:59
committees, base information in the system prompt, so it knows, like, the bare minimum, I guess, and the rest is in the database.

[Andy Shang] 00:03:06
And then… let's a simple, who am I?

[Andy Shang] 00:03:12
Yeah, who am I?

[Andy Shang] 00:03:17
Uh, yep. And see, this who am I… the way it fetches my information is actually from my Discord ID.

[Andy Shang] 00:03:24
Which is linked in my Discord ID,

[Andy Shang] 00:03:27
to… my member name and my member ID. So through here, we can Discord ID, messenger ID, everything is linked together, and then the AI and my internal system code will be able to differentiate each person, and then locate them effectively.

[Andy Shang] 00:03:42
Yeah. And then…

[Andy Shang] 00:03:45
This is something that I know one of our executives has always been annoyed about.

[Andy Shang] 00:03:50
Uh, getting people's emails, so I can now ask, since I've already ingested it,

[Andy Shang] 00:03:55
uh… give me some of the…

[Andy Shang] 00:03:58
emails of the executive.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:01
members. Currently, as you can see, only me and Michael have been ingested, so…

[Andy Shang] 00:04:06
If nothing goes wrong, it should return both of those emails.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:09
Yep. That's great. And then in the future, when we actually get this into production, all the officers, directors will have older emails, as well as other information.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:17
We can add freely onto there so that…

[Andy Shang] 00:04:20
If we ever need anything, we can fetch it easily.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:22
And then, more on the task side.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:25
I… okay.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:27
What are my current tasks?

[Andy Shang] 00:04:38
Okay, so these are my current tasks, some of which is the demo dial, some of which is the trial run me and Michael went yesterday, as well as Michael being a bit cheeky there.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:49
Okay, Michael, for sure.

[Andy Shang] 00:04:53
And it shows I have completed it, and then another feature right now is that through the bot, I can say that

[Andy Shang] 00:04:59
I have completed

[Andy Shang] 00:05:03
Uh… which I have not completed yet. I have completed the defining…

[Andy Shang] 00:05:08
Campus Chef MVP scope.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:10
And then it should be able to register in the database.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:14
From incomplete to complete.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:18
Complete. Easy.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:22
Crypto completing an update in the database instantly, so that in the future,

[Andy Shang] 00:05:26
updated tasks, as well as assigning tasks to people will be much easier.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:30
And, um… alright, a few more examples. Uh, oh yeah, I feel like this would be important.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:36
Who is in the marketing subcommittee?

[Andy Shang] 00:05:41
These are just a few examples of fun.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:43
As well as just use… everyday use cases, I'd say.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:47
That's okay. So far, Mia and Ben Carter, a made-up person,

[Andy Shang] 00:05:51
Works perfectly.

[Andy Shang] 00:05:53
And then…

[Andy Shang] 00:05:56
meetings, yes. Uh, another… a huge part of this…

[Andy Shang] 00:05:59
is the meeting integration, as well as the meeting…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:04
uh, information retaining and…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:06
Uh, how do I say this? Uh, retaining and be able to regurgitate it in an effective sense to the members.

[Andy Shang] 00:06:12
So…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:14
what happened in the last meeting I attended?

[Andy Shang] 00:06:19
Because some people, maybe after a week, they will forget what happened in the last meeting, and then, of course, a small reminder, without having to ask people or look at their notes, which they definitely didn't make, would be very easy.

[Andy Shang] 00:06:32
This was the…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:34
trial meaning me and Michael did yesterday.

[Andy Shang] 00:06:36
We basically had a ton of key points, all of these, uh…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:41
work perfectly. What can I say?

[Andy Shang] 00:06:43
Um… okay. As well as…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:47
summarize all the meetings I have.

[Andy Shang] 00:06:50
attended.

[Andy Shang] 00:06:53
Oh, this is already summarized, so…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:54
We don't really need this. Uh, this transcript is stored, um…

[Andy Shang] 00:06:58
So far, locally, but okay, note this again, set a task for Andy Shane.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:03
to integrate a Google Drive API for our system.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:09
at the end of next week, as well.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:11
Okay, so Google Drive, and then we will have to store the meeting transcripts locally, we can have them online, anyone can upload them, anyone can…

[Andy Shang] 00:07:19
be able to…

[Andy Shang] 00:07:22
access that, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:26
We attend the meeting projects.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:29
I was at other projects which is similar to this.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:32
Who's doing what projects, all that.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:35
Actually, yes.

[Andy Shang] 00:07:40
Tell me comprehensively who is assigned

[Andy Shang] 00:07:43
to what project?

[Andy Shang] 00:07:47
And projects, in this sense, is not just a project subcommittee. Projects are…

[Andy Shang] 00:07:52
So any big…

[Andy Shang] 00:07:54
task. Any collection of tasks that any group or singular person is engaged in.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:00
So, it's not just the projects teams, um, maybe a website, but also, like, if the marketing team has to create

[Andy Shang] 00:08:07
proper material for the open week stand.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:11
then that itself would be an entire project with sub-tasks like creating posters,

[Andy Shang] 00:08:17
getting the banner setup, all that.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:20
Okay, that works.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:27
Michaels try it?

[Andy Shang] 00:08:30
Yeah, perfect.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:32
And this… this was a task I just completed, as you can see right above there.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:36
Easily. Okay, and um… topics. Topics was mainly…

[Andy Shang] 00:08:43
an easier, more cost-effective way of being able to collect information over a large range of

[Andy Shang] 00:08:50
meetings and pre-existing data points.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:52
Uh, which is mainly on outside to worry about. You don't really have to worry about topics, that's fine.

[Andy Shang] 00:08:57
And then… let's see…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:01
Okay, let's get on to something fun.

[Andy Shang] 00:09:03
Uh, this was what me and Michael tried yesterday. It was basically…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:08
Who has attended…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:12
the least meetings so far.

[Andy Shang] 00:09:14
And since in each meeting, we will be able to easily track the attendance, as well as be able to ingest that attendance into the database,

[Andy Shang] 00:09:24
We can also easily see who hasn't been in the meetings.

[Andy Shang] 00:09:27
And this is not only…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:29
Cool information to have, but also will keep up the…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:33
the standard of participation, commitment in the society, which is great.

[Andy Shang] 00:09:38
And so far, my two made-up people have attended zero meetings so far. Very unfortunate. Everyone else has attended two or more.

[Andy Shang] 00:09:47
And then…

[Andy Shang] 00:09:49
Uh, anything else you want to try, Michael?

[Andy Shang] 00:10:01
Yes, that is…

[Andy Shang] 00:10:04
Yeah, that is just not a data point we have discussed yet, Michael.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:07
And I… I don't know if this is something we'll include in the future either.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:12
feels like… uh…

[Andy Shang] 00:10:15
Maybe we could, but I guess a way to…

[Andy Shang] 00:10:18
get this information out, who spoke to the most in the meetings would also be who has the most tasks aside, who completed the most tasks.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:24
To see if they had actually done their job.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:27
And participation-wise as well.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:29
And, um, like I said, two more last examples before we get on to the meeting transcript ingestion.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:35
Okay. Uh…

[Andy Shang] 00:10:39
That's it. Okay, yeah, this is good.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:42
Uh, based on the previous

[Andy Shang] 00:10:46
paths and topics.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:47
completed.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:50
give me an agenda to discuss.

[Andy Shang] 00:10:56
For the next.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:00
Executive meeting.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:04
And now this is the… we looked already at the past.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:07
the present, which is doing this, and now the future.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:10
how it can help us prepare agendas and also more easily

[Andy Shang] 00:11:15
Just prepare overall for the future meetings.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:18
Okay, project updates. Effects older projects and existing database, task review,

[Andy Shang] 00:11:22
Okay, Michael, sure. Okay. And uh… new initiatives, operation matters, and all of this

[Andy Shang] 00:11:30
I got, uh, currently it's connected to a…

[Andy Shang] 00:11:33
ChatGPT 4.1 Mini.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:35
API, which…

[Andy Shang] 00:11:37
is what is doing all the summarization and all the…

[Andy Shang] 00:11:41
effective planning right now.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:43
And then… let's see…

[Andy Shang] 00:11:47
My last one…

[Andy Shang] 00:11:51
Oh yeah, this is fun.

[Andy Shang] 00:11:57
T-O-D-R this semester.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:11
Okay? That adds up. That's basically all the dummy data I've ingested so far.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:16
And it can be a nice way to revise, or just…

[Andy Shang] 00:12:20
not forget about anything we've forgotten.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:22
And then, one last one, last one.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:24
Uh, this is for the general members and any directors, right, I guess.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:28
What should I focus on?

[Andy Shang] 00:12:31
This will mainly fetch from the task table, but also projects and…

[Andy Shang] 00:12:36
Just a general thing, since I'm an executive in the database right now, it'll give me more…

[Andy Shang] 00:12:42
information regarding it, but the general members will mainly be aimed at their own tasks, as well as their subcommittee.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:48
Gross. Michael, you're thinking, I swear to God. Alright, Michael. Okay, okay, okay.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:54
Okay, Michael, okay.

[Andy Shang] 00:12:58
Okay.

[Andy Shang] 00:13:02
Are you gonna try something else, Michael, or should we move on to… okay.

[Andy Shang] 00:13:08
Uh, alright, I'll stop sharing my screen.

[Andy Shang] 00:13:10
And now we will move on to…

[Andy Shang] 00:13:13
Yes, the transcript…

[Andy Shang] 00:13:15
extraction process.

[Andy Shang] 00:13:19
So, uh, we've actually started keeping transcripts, basically just recording everything me and Michael has said so far.

[Andy Shang] 00:13:29
Well, mainly, basically everything I've said so far, uh, in the video so far, which you can get ingest into the database.
