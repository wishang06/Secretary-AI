[Andy Shang] 17:37:31
so good. Can't lie.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:37:32
Okay. Leave it as is, then.

[Andy Shang] 17:37:34
Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:37:34
Yeah, Alex will leave it as is.

[Andy Shang] 17:37:37
Executive meeting.

[Andy Shang] 17:37:40
One, before the…

[Andy Shang] 17:37:42
the term starts.

[Alex] 17:37:43
Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:37:48
was 6pm.

[Alex] 17:37:49
Now can we do… wait, I think we should do now.

[Alex] 17:37:54
Are we doing that?

[Andy Shang] 17:37:55
I'd prefer now. I can't do 6.

[Alex] 17:38:00
Uh…

[Alex] 17:38:02
I reckon, let's just… yeah, wait for the others to join.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:06
Others is just Sam, I don't know.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:13
Michael can't join anyway.

[Alex] 17:38:13
Let's, um, no.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:15
Mike will be able to try at, like, 9 or something.

[Alex] 17:38:17
Oh,

[Alex] 17:38:19
Interesting. What does he do for work?

[Andy Shang] 17:38:22
apparently has a Nepo IB internship in China.

[Alex] 17:38:27
checks out.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:38:28
Checks out.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:28
I'm gonna check that.

[Alex] 17:38:29
Now, then he shouldn't be joining until, like, 11, or later.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:32
Yeah, so Michael, Michael just, like…

[Andy Shang] 17:38:35
Can't do it now.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:38:37
Classic.

[Andy Shang] 17:38:44
Interesting.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:38:45
Hmm…

[Alex] 17:38:51
Hmm…

[Alex] 17:38:53
Hmm…

[Alex] 17:38:56
Hmm, Raymond.

[Alex] 17:38:59
Hmm.

[Alex] 17:39:01
Hmm…

[Alex] 17:39:07
I reckon it's gonna be Messenger.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:10
Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:39:11
Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:12
No, the only thing I'm thinking is that…

[Andy Shang] 17:39:15
Basically, are we more a tech club or a commerce club? Because older tech clubs…

[Andy Shang] 17:39:19
Discord is their first thing.

[Alex] 17:39:22
Well, business analytics is technically commerce, so…

[Andy Shang] 17:39:24
That is true. But, like…

[Andy Shang] 17:39:26
We also need to do all of the tech stuff as well.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:29
If we ever have to share code with Messenger is just not ideal.

[Alex] 17:39:31
way, which things use Discord, because I don't actually know a single club that uses Discord.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:39:35
That's because Alex doesn't look outside the commerce clubs.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:37
No problem. Okay, okay.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:40
uh, CISA?

[Andy Shang] 17:39:42
CISA, DS cubed.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:43
AI Club.

[Alex] 17:39:43
Oh, that actually checks out. That checks out.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:39:46
literally checks out, by the way, Alex.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:48
just every tech club.

[Alex] 17:39:52
Where is Sam?

[Andy Shang] 17:39:54
Wow.

[Alex] 17:39:55
Oh, it's, uh, oh, this, um, speak of the devil.

[Andy Shang] 17:39:57
Uh-huh.

[Samuel Choong] 17:39:59
Uh…

[Alex] 17:40:00
Alright, guys, before we, like, go on the, um…

[Alex] 17:40:02
go into the list of stuff I need to ask a question, just because I think I've gotten a little bit confused. It could have me, like, 30 seconds to explain.

[Alex] 17:40:09
So, I know we've got the shadowing thing, just so I… could someone explain to me how we're running with that? Because in VAP, which I'm also in,

[Alex] 17:40:17
We usually have the directors in the meeting as well, which is where then it's sort of like…

[Alex] 17:40:22
them discussing, but are we sort of doing it like we essentially take their place?

[Alex] 17:40:27
in this meeting, and then sort of act as the mid… the discussion point between everyone.

[Alex] 17:40:33
Is that correct? Um…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:40:35
That's what I had in mind, but…

[Samuel Choong] 17:40:36
Yeah, that's what I had as well, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:40:38
Yeah, that's fair enough.

[Alex] 17:40:39
Okay, good, just wanted to make sure, because I… yeah.

[Alex] 17:40:42
I got…

[Samuel Choong] 17:40:42
Anyway, the way I had it is we had meetings with the directors, and then we report to each other.

[Samuel Choong] 17:40:47
about what each portfolio's doing, so we know what every… like, how everything is going.

[Alex] 17:40:48
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:40:52
You know what I mean?

[Alex] 17:40:52
Ah, okay, there's a difference, because we…

[Alex] 17:40:54
don't do that, we just have everyone in the same meeting. Okay, cool. Thanks for confirming that.

[Samuel Choong] 17:40:57
Uh, we could… we could do that, but I think the issue is just, like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:01
With the amount of directors and execs that we have.

[Alex] 17:41:04
be too many people.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:05
It's gonna be so ages to find a time that everyone's free.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:05
Uh, yeah, that's true, that's true.

[Alex] 17:41:08
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:10
Have you played the new Fortnite season?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:13
No, wait, what is it?

[Andy Shang] 17:41:15
What?

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:15
Wait, it's like jetpacks and shit. Have you guys played it?

[Alex] 17:41:17
Wait, actually, gotta hop on this.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:18
Jetpacks?

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:18
Yeah. It is jetpacks, there's, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:20
Ooh, we're gonna hop on.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:22
Or…

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:22
There's, like, an AR that, like, locks on, like, you scope in, and there's, like, a square.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:25
Oh, I've seen… oh yeah, I've seen clips of the AR, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:26
Yeah, yeah, and like, it locks on, and you just shoot, and it auto-locks on for you.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:31
What is it? Is that just aimbot? The hell?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:31
Yeah, that's crazy.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:32
Yeah, it's just our aim bar, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:33
I see it, bro, it's disgustingly OP, like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:36
Bro, all the fucking nerdy-ass controller players use it, no offense.

[Alex] 17:41:40
That sounds about right.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:40
But… Oh my god.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:41
checks out.

[Alex] 17:41:43
Who's a controller player here?

[Andy Shang] 17:41:44
Literally me, by the way. PS5 only.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:41:45
Let's say Andy.

[Alex] 17:41:46
Ew, Andy, ew.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:47
Come on, Andy, gotta get a PC, bro.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:48
PS5 is the only way to play, Colin.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:50
Gotta get a PC, Andy.

[Alex] 17:41:51
get a PC, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:52
Ooh, Stein, though.

[Andy Shang] 17:41:54
It's rough.

[Samuel Choong] 17:41:58
Oh, do you actually use PS5, Andy?

[Andy Shang] 17:41:59
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:00
Is it… is it good FPS?

[Andy Shang] 17:42:03
60?

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:04
Damn.

[Andy Shang] 17:42:04
Which is not… not… not horribly great, but…

[Alex] 17:42:07
That's not good. Gotta hop on the 240, gotta hop on the 240.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:42:08
Yeah, that is not good.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:11
Well, you need 240Hz, man.

[Andy Shang] 17:42:13
We're not competitive, it's true.

[Alex] 17:42:17
Why not, though?

[Andy Shang] 17:42:17
We're story players. We play for the story.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:42:18
Brandy only just started playing anyway, like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:21
Uh…

[Alex] 17:42:22
Uh, that means that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to change to a keyboard and mouse. That's good.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:26
You can literally just input your keyboard and mouse into the PS5, like you.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:26
You can

[Raymond Jiang] 17:42:29
Yeah, literally.

[Alex] 17:42:29
are valid. Valid.

[Andy Shang] 17:42:29
That is true. Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:30
It's just like…

[Andy Shang] 17:42:31
Look, I play Minecraft with a control.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:33
Yeah, FPS is so chase.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:42:34
Wait, Andy plays Minecraft with his control. And he plays Minecraft on his PC, and he plays with a controller.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:37
Oh, why did you say Minecraft with a controller?

[Andy Shang] 17:42:42
Yeah, no, I can't with the last one.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:43
Right, nah, Andy, you're a different breed, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:42:43
Like, he plays Java with the controller.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:47
Andy, you're a different breed, bro.

[Alex] 17:42:47
Oh, hell no!

[Andy Shang] 17:42:48
I did some mod for that, bro. That's how complicated.

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:52
Are we waiting for, um…

[Alex] 17:42:54
I don't think anyone else joining?

[Samuel Choong] 17:42:56
Where is Analyst? Is she joining from the train, or…?

[Alex] 17:42:59
I don't think so, I can't lie.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:00
Probably not.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:43:01
She's just not joining her.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:03
Uh, wait, why don't we just ask you to join from the train?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:43:07
Yeah, do it. Hm.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:08
I mean, she can just listen in, it's fine.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:08
You wanna…

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:10
So, Loki, you know, I like the bot, but I'm…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:43:10
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:12
I'm gonna say that right now, I'm heavily against using Discord as our main comps.

[Alex] 17:43:17
Yeah, don't worry, Sam, I think we should use Messenger, too.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:17
That's just…

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:20
Oh, moms, I'm heavily against that shit. I… I don't want to.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:23
But… but… but I will say, I respect you and Michael a lot for making the bot, because that shit's kinda cool.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:24
Okay.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:28
Alright. Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:29
Like, you guys actually worked really hard for that. I respect that.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:32
Okay, so Discord would just be note-taking and, uh, information keeping track of

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:36
I mean, I don't mind doing a test with the execs, you know what I mean? Like…

[Andy Shang] 17:43:37
Basically.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:41
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:41
I'm personally not wanting to do it, but if we test it with the execs, and it's like, oh, wow, that's pretty good, then maybe…

[Alex] 17:43:47
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:43:47
No, I think the main issue is not that it won't work, it's that what type of club are we trying to be?

[Andy Shang] 17:43:52
Because every single tech club uses Discord.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:43:55
What the fucking kind of club is this?

[Alex] 17:43:56
Business Analytics is commerce, though.

[Samuel Choong] 17:43:58
Hey, hey, bro, do we got FBE affiliation, or what? Like…

[Alex] 17:44:00
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:44:02
Oh, I mean, you're right, but… Fine.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:04
As in, uh, maybe ProJes could use it.

[Andy Shang] 17:44:04
Fine.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:07
Maybe projects, you know?

[Alex] 17:44:09
Oh, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:09
Because it'll probably be… it'll likely be easier.

[Andy Shang] 17:44:09
Oh, because… oh yeah, projects, if we have to share code or something, that would be way easier.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:12
Her projects.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:14
But, like, bombard, like, I'm trying to envision, like,

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:18
officers trying to use Discord, who've never used Discord in their lives.

[Alex] 17:44:22
Oh…

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:22
And it was so… like, I'm not…

[Andy Shang] 17:44:26
What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:26
But, like, the thing… what's it called?

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:29
I thought that would be a very big… I don't know, gap.

[Alex] 17:44:31
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. We apparently haven't done the bystander intervention and responding to disclosures training requirements.

[Andy Shang] 17:44:36
Oh yeah, I just saw that email.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:39
What?

[Andy Shang] 17:44:39
Wait, wasn't Michael supposed to do that?

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:41
Hey, Mike! We can literally just do it now, no.

[Andy Shang] 17:44:43
Bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:44:45
Do we… is that the one where we… oh, no, no, no.

[Alex] 17:44:48
It's on the 20th or 27th of Feb, or the 10th, i.e. tomorrow.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:54
I did it in person.

[Alex] 17:44:55
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:44:57
Wait, is it input? Oh.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:00
Alright, see you, Raven. That's all you, King.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:01
Bro, I went to the… nah, bro, I went to the other one, this one's all you guys.

[Alex] 17:45:04
Nah, thanks, Raymond, we really appreciate it.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:05
What the heck?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:06
I went to the other one. I went to the other one.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:06
Raven, you're the GOAT, bro. You and Addie… you and Andy can make your time up.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:07
Bruh.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:09
Before you go to Shanghai.

[Alex] 17:45:10
Oh, good idea! Yeah, because you won't be here this time, so do your part right now.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:13
Yeah… Andy, you live in the city, too. Andy, you live in the city too.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:15
Yeah, I'll… I'll go.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:17
That's true, I need Lucy lives in the city.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:18
Wait, do we need one… how many people do we need?

[Andy Shang] 17:45:19
Wait, was it 10?

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:20
You need to. You need to. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Two with at least one exec.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:21
But it's tomorrow, what the hunk?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:21
Do we need two, or…?

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:26
So you can be a director with you if you want, right?

[Andy Shang] 17:45:29
Fuck.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:30
Yeah, Andy, yeah, bring your direct in, okay?

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:33
So fucked up, bro.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:33
Oh my god. What, who's even here? I swear no one's here.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:35
Uh, so…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:36
No, I can go, I can go.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:39
Uh, I would like to go back. My Fahi knee is still cooked.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:41
So… one input… oh, yo, the in-person workshop is 90 minutes.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:42
Oh, yikes.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:42
That's true. I can go.

[Alex] 17:45:46
Yikes.

[Andy Shang] 17:45:47
Oh my god.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:47
Stay fucking safe.

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:49
Oh, that sounds like ass.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:50
But it doesn't… it literally doesn't make sense for us to do it because

[Raymond Jiang] 17:45:52
I'm not gonna be here. Does that make sense?

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:54
Yeah, I know, but, like, I feel like bystander, like, this is pretty…

[Samuel Choong] 17:45:58
self-explanatory, you know.

[Andy Shang] 17:46:00
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:46:00
Yeah, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:01
Oh, you can do the online one as well.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:04
Uh… have we heard back from ACNC, or RMC yet?

[Andy Shang] 17:46:05
Two committee members.

[Alex] 17:46:07
Still not, and no umsu either.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:46:09
We are… that's it, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:11
So we never…

[Alex] 17:46:11
Hopefully, we hear back from them, because it's going to be a problem otherwise.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:14
We never applied to…

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:16
the clubs and Society is what we need.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:19
what equipment we'll be using. They said…

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:21
Reply to us by 5pm, and we just never replied.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:46:24
Oh, shit.

[Alex] 17:46:24
Oh yeah, who put in the request for, like,

[Alex] 17:46:27
um, power outlets, or whatever it was.

[Alex] 17:46:29
No, it was like, I thought that the submitting what you needed was to use power.

[Andy Shang] 17:46:29
How well it…

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:30
Power owls?

[Alex] 17:46:34
But let me double-check.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:34
I have no idea. Oh…

[Andy Shang] 17:46:35
I'll put what? Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:37
Also, do you guys just want to cop the banner?

[Alex] 17:46:40
I don't mind, I'm… I don't mind. It'd just be like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:40
Like, I can buy an office voice. Are you guys down and just split it?

[Andy Shang] 17:46:42
Yeah, sure.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:46:43
Dottom line.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:43
I do want to split with the directors as well? Is that… is that kind of sting?

[Alex] 17:46:44
It was, like, 10 bucks each tops.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:46:47
Nah, that's stinge.

[Alex] 17:46:47
Look, they might be open to it, I don't know, but…

[Andy Shang] 17:46:50
That's too many people.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:50
Uh… but, like, the higher number of people you split it with, the cheaper it is.

[Andy Shang] 17:46:52
Wait,

[Alex] 17:46:54
the lower the price is.

[Andy Shang] 17:46:55
That is true.

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:56
you know, the higher the numerator.

[Andy Shang] 17:46:57
We could… we could…

[Samuel Choong] 17:46:59
a denominator back.

[Andy Shang] 17:47:00
Wait, how much is it?

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:01
It's… wait…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:47:02
Bro, so it's like $90 or something there.

[Alex] 17:47:04
Yeah, so I split that between, like, 13 people. It's like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:06
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:07
I think it's this one, no. Wait, have a look at this.

[Alex] 17:47:09
Six bucks a…

[Alex] 17:47:10
No, it's like 8 bucks each, and 7 or 8.

[Andy Shang] 17:47:10
Okay, very easy

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:12
Have a look at this.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:15
Is this not this one?

[Andy Shang] 17:47:15
7 or 8, ratio is not 6 or 7.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:18
Is it not this one? Check the Zoom chat. I swear it's this…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:47:19
Yes.

[Alex] 17:47:20
Da-da…

[Alex] 17:47:24
Yeah, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:26
Yo, why is this shit 85?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:47:28
Hmm…

[Andy Shang] 17:47:30
Oh my god.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:30
Right, who's… wait, what? Are we doing 610?

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:34
buy one, or we're doing 8-4-1.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:37
Are you doing big or small?

[Alex] 17:47:39
big show, let's do big…

[Alex] 17:47:40
Extra, 10 bucks.

[Andy Shang] 17:47:40
What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:40
But how big… wait, whoa…

[Andy Shang] 17:47:43
Oh, that was 10 bucks on Instagram.

[Alex] 17:47:43
2 meters tall!

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:45
Whoa, whoa, whoa, do we need 2 meters? Hold up.

[Andy Shang] 17:47:47
That's slightly dope.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:48
Do we need 2 meters?

[Alex] 17:47:50
I don't even know.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:47:50
No, we don't. We just don't. That's…

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:52
15 centimeters is chill now.

[Samuel Choong] 17:47:54
I mean, like, 1.5 meters is fine.

[Alex] 17:47:57
Well, I think Pima left the 1.5 based on my guess, the big, uh… I was gonna say because the big one's black, but I don't see anyone have a black one, but then you go to the final image, and the big one can also be silver, so I have no idea.

[Andy Shang] 17:47:57
I mean, it will be seen better.

[Andy Shang] 17:48:07
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:08
Create.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:48:09
Wait, is the black one bigger?

[Alex] 17:48:11
No, no, no, no, no. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:12
Are they not the same? Yeah, the black one is bigger.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:48:14
Oh, that checks out.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:15
I don't think we need that big, though, no.

[Andy Shang] 17:48:16
Well…

[Andy Shang] 17:48:17
Yeah. I don't think any club has two used.

[Alex] 17:48:18
Nah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:18
And then… do we just… how do we print off the actual banner?

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:22
As in, do we send it to Officeworks?

[Alex] 17:48:22
Just order it online, pick up from a shop.

[Andy Shang] 17:48:23
Do we just send it to them?

[Andy Shang] 17:48:26
I think so. After you press Create.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:28
Uh, let me see how this works.

[Andy Shang] 17:48:36
Or we can choose the…

[Andy Shang] 17:48:38
Which cloth do we use?

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:38
What would you like to do? Oh, design… we can upload our design.

[Alex] 17:48:41
Yeah, that's good.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:42
Wait, let me see how this works.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:44
Let me see if I can upload the one that…

[Andy Shang] 17:48:46
PVC film, oh my god.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:48
Shawna might… Okay, should we wait for Annalise?

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:51
Yeah, she's in the waiting room, Andy.

[Andy Shang] 17:48:53
Oh, shit, my bad… my bad. I have 3 screens.

[Alex] 17:48:54
Bro, Andy!

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:55
Right. Nah, nah, nah, nah.

[Alex] 17:48:57
Guys, three screens? Prove it.

[Samuel Choong] 17:48:59
Audio 3 screen… show your camera right now.

[Andy Shang] 17:49:01
of, like, prove it? Okay, sure. Uh, can you see it?

[Andy Shang] 17:49:05
Here's one, my belief.

[Alex] 17:49:05
Are you counting your laptop as two?

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:05
Why do you have an ace a…

[Andy Shang] 17:49:07
Yeah, I was trying to…

[Alex] 17:49:09
Nah, that's one.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:09
The laptop does… no, his laptop does have two screens, though, by the way.

[Andy Shang] 17:49:10
It's issued two screens.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:13
Wait, what? Oh, do you have the bottom one, as well?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:17
his, like, his keyboard is…

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:17
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:49:17
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:19
is the thing as well.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:20
Wait, where is the banner? Is it in marketing?

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:23
It is a week by now.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:26
Did I send it to you?

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:28
You've noticed in the SharePoint, are I?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:29
Oh, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:30
Uh, let's see if I can upload it.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:32
The dimensions have to be right there.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:35
Yeah, the bit…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:49:36
What are the dimensions?

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:38
The band is a bit bigger. Like, the picture's a bit bigger than the actual dimensions.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:42
I think they're checking. Okay, well, we'll do this later. Okay, Annalise is here.

[Andy Shang] 17:49:45
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:46
Um, should we go through, like, a portfolio update?

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:51
From everywhere. Have you guys all had meetings with…

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:54
Your…

[Samuel Choong] 17:49:56
respective, like, portfolios.

[Alex] 17:49:58
To be honest, no, because I misunderstood it, and I didn't check it until now.

[Andy Shang] 17:49:59
Yes.

[Alex] 17:50:03
So, I'll organise a meeting for, like, in the next couple days, but…

[Alex] 17:50:06
Um, we've got, like, the retreat data is confirmed, which was a big thing at the time.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:11
Yup. And then we also…

[Alex] 17:50:11
then we've got to confirm their… oh, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:12
I get it. Uh, you keep going.

[Alex] 17:50:15
Should I say the recruitment timeline's the other big thing, because then we've got to connect through to marketing and stuff.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:17
Hmm.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:20
Yeah, uh…

[Alex] 17:50:21
Um, and book rooms, maybe even do that.

[Andy Shang] 17:50:21
That's fair.

[Alex] 17:50:23
Now.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:23
Sorry, what's the difference between content creation and marketing, by the way?

[Andy Shang] 17:50:27
Only? Yes.

[Alex] 17:50:27
Content creations, reels, marketing is, like, the Instagram posts.

[Andy Shang] 17:50:31
Yeah.

[Alex] 17:50:31
And posters in FBE.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:32
Right.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:50:32
Pretty much.

[Andy Shang] 17:50:34
Content creation can be less serious.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:36
I wish my eye was here. Okay, um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:39
Do you just want to start off with marketing, then? Have you had a meeting, Raymond? Is it Raymond, or is it Andy?

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:44
Which one of you guys is shadowing?

[Andy Shang] 17:50:45
Uh, both, actually.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:50:46
It's kind of birth.

[Andy Shang] 17:50:47
If speaker's content creation also kind of… puts it close together.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:49
Yeah, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:50:52
It's more like one team, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:50:53
Uh, very, very… yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:57
Um… so what do you guys…

[Samuel Choong] 17:50:59
How's your meetings going, guys?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:01
I haven't had a meeting since, like, the…

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:03
That'd be good.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:04
that, like, first one, but, like, we've been communicating a lot through messengers, it's like…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:08
It's true.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:08
Okay, is there any updates that we need to know about, or, like, what kind of work have you guys been talking about?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:15
Shawna started making the recruitment booklet.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:20
As well. Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:51:21
Yes.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:21
Yep. Did you tell her to make the recurring booklet?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:24
Yeah, I just let her know, like…

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:26
Okay. Uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:27
Pretty much. It's mostly using design from the banner, so it's, like, similar type.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:32
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:33
type beat, but, like, I don't know, pretty, pretty straightforward. I let her know, like, all the…

[Andy Shang] 17:51:33
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:37
what is it, the, like, rule descriptions in the SharePoint as well, so…

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:40
Yeah. Yeah, that's calm.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:42
She has access to all of that, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:43
Also, I think we should probably include photos of the directors, no?

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:47
What do you think? I think, um…

[Andy Shang] 17:51:47
Oh, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:51:48
Oh yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:49
This is a bit off-top, but when we have calm bonding,

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:51
Like, with just us and the directors, we should look at spam photos.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:55
So we have, like…

[Alex] 17:51:56
Ah, good idea, good idea.

[Andy Shang] 17:51:57
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:51:57
So you have, like, material to use, if you know what I mean.

[Alex] 17:52:00
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:01
Um…

[Andy Shang] 17:52:03
Oh, we need to side on that date as well.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:05
Yeah… I think that's probably asked for…

[Andy Shang] 17:52:06
When is funding?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:07
It's likely gonna be, like, next week, England.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:10
Yeah, it's like you gotta be asked to plan it as well.

[Andy Shang] 17:52:12
you know.

[Alex] 17:52:12
Yeah, we said 16th to 20th was, like, THE window, so…

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:15
Yeah. Um…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:18
Like, he… I can, like, on due 20th, or…

[Andy Shang] 17:52:20
19th.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:21
not 19th either. Or Andy Conte, 19th, anyway.

[Alex] 17:52:24
So, then it's Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

[Andy Shang] 17:52:24
So, s

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:26
Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:52:27
1617 would be great.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:29
Yeah, I know why I said that.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:31
I was trying to be sneaky.

[Alex] 17:52:32
Did you say that because of 6-7?

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:34
But I try to be sneaky.

[Andy Shang] 17:52:37
Almost what?

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:38
You're trying to be sneaky, but…

[Alex] 17:52:38
Riven67?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:41
Can we have some maturity, Alex?

[Alex] 17:52:43
I was trying to get you to do it again.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:44
lock. Get this phone, combo.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:52:47
To what?

[Alex] 17:52:48
do the, the, you know what you did, I don't know how to describe it.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:50
Okay. Do you want to move on to events? Is there any more marketing updates that we need now, apart from the recruitment booklet?

[Alex] 17:52:56
Annalise messaged in the chat about events, just by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 17:52:58
Yeah. I asked my if she wanted to meet, and she said closer to when the first event was.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:06
Our analysts, I would recommend you to…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:09
push back against that and tell her to…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:12
private meeting, what are you doing? Have a meeting, like, like,

[Alex] 17:53:14
Right? Lock in!

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:16
have a meeting, like, ASAP, so you can…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:18
really flush out your events timeline.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:21
I think it's better to meet earlier when you have time now.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:24
Versus meeting closer to when the first event is.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:29
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:31
We can't do that with spawns, yeah. We were talking about that as well.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:34
We can have a joint meeting response.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:38
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:43
Because we also need to, um, have a cost of a meeting.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:46
Because we need events. We need to know more about events to build our…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:50
Sponsorship prospectus.

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:54
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:53:58
And then take away how long we have to wait.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:01
Uh, I mean, you just have a meeting ASAP, to be honest. If you want.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:06
I'm having a meeting this week.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:09
on Sunday.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:10
With… hopefully Michael and…

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:14
Teresa, and then if you want…

[Alex] 17:54:15
Do you want me to come to this one's one as well? I'm happy to… I can pass along, um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:19
Um…

[Alex] 17:54:21
some contacts that I know of as well, if you guys would like. I could also try and get us Monster Energy. I know the guy that you reach out to for that.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:28
Monster? What the hell?

[Andy Shang] 17:54:29
the… I don't calm down.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:29
Yeah, you can try. You can come, or you can just give us… you can also…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:30
What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:32
I mean, I don't mind, you can either come, or, like, you can give us the contact details, and we can help talk.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:37
Once the sponsorship would be huge, because they're not at events and shit, we can, like… or, like, stores and shit, we can't…

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:41
Nah, bro, this guy's just thinking about caffeine right now.

[Alex] 17:54:44
No, no, he is.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:44
Yeah, but just think about it. I don't even Drink Monster, but it's like, think about it, like, now we have, like, something that, like, the little

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:48
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:49
kids would actually want, you know what I mean?

[Andy Shang] 17:54:52
little kids? What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:52
Yeah, yeah, are we getting…

[Alex] 17:54:52
Yeah, well, you see, what happened is I got… I got Monster for BAP last year, and then it got passed on to someone else.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:54:55
a little chods, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 17:54:57
Are we getting Prime next?

[Alex] 17:54:58
And there's someone else I got passed on to, they kind of dropped the ball with it, so we don't talk, deal with them.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:01
Wait, so you're gonna get Monster, but then you didn't?

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:03
Oh, shit.

[Alex] 17:55:05
We did, we got stuff from them multiple times, but then whoever was on with it, between SEM1 and SEM2 dropped the ball, so…

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:11
Okay, we can try to get Monster, I don't mind. I'll put that in…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:11
They dropped the ball.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:19
I actually have something to give out at Souls.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:21
We can also get Red Bull now, isn't Red Bull so easy to get?

[Alex] 17:55:23
Red Bull is B1, though, so they might not.

[Alex] 17:55:26
But they might. They give so much to B1, it's not even funny.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:27
Well, just because it…

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:28
I swear, Rebel's everyone, though.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:29
But don't… don't they, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:32
Solbing. Soul Bing.

[Andy Shang] 17:55:33
What the heck?

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:34
Solving… yeah, okay.

[Alex] 17:55:34
Saul Bing also does like everyone. You can get that easily.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:35
Exactly, exactly. That's my point.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:36
Okay, well, let's…

[Andy Shang] 17:55:37
We could actually get that one.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:38
That's our point.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:39
Um… okay, let's go back to events. I have seen the SharePoint analyze, it is looking good.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:44
I like the… I like the…

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:46
None of it, because what events have done is they want to do, like, a hackathon…

[Alex] 17:55:50
Oh, nice.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:50
And a, uh, like, careers panel, and then workshops.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:54
It was really sweaty, by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:55
Inshallah. Show your ass up there.

[Andy Shang] 17:55:55
Yeah, I saw that

[Raymond Jiang] 17:55:57
Alright.

[Andy Shang] 17:55:58
hackathon… hackathon.

[Samuel Choong] 17:55:59
Um, I think in terms of event-wise, which event we do first is relatively important.

[Alex] 17:56:05
Yeah, it's first impressions.

[Andy Shang] 17:56:05
Yes.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:06
I don't… I don't know, it's up to you guys.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:09
Which…

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:12
which one we want to do. I mean, personally,

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:13
I think… oh, here you go.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:14
I don't know. I thought careers would be a better event.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:17
I agree, because I think careers makes the most sense, especially since a lot of people are not familiar with business analytics.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:17
compared to Hackathon.

[Andy Shang] 17:56:18
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:22
Yeah… that…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:23
As well, like, it kinda…

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:24
To be fair, at the same time,

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:26
doing hackathon first could also be helpful, because if we can get… we can farm, like, a lot of statistics from that, like, engagement statistics, so I don't think…

[Andy Shang] 17:56:31
Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:56:34
But…

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:34
I think either way, it'll be okay.

[Alex] 17:56:35
Are ya valid?

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:38
you know.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:38
True, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:56:38
But I think a lot of people… a lot less people would attend the hackathon compared to careers.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:42
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:43
I agree. I think Korea's… I think Korea's…

[Andy Shang] 17:56:43
panel.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:45
Okay, but I think analysts… let me know…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:56:46
Just my opinion.

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:49
And at least you can, I guess, communicate that with…

[annalise] 17:56:51
I'm walking now, so I can talk more. But with the careers, yeah, I think we had that. We were planning to put that more at the top, but again, it's sponsored because you need someone to support, right?

[Samuel Choong] 17:56:52
Oh, nice.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:03
Yeah, yeah. That's why we'll have a joint… joint meeting.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:08
I think. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:10
like, with spawns as well.

[annalise] 17:57:13
Yeah, I'll tell them… I mean, sooner than later, so we can come. But if you look in the chat, I've been talking about…

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:24
Dude, why? Yeah, why can't you not get a messenger? It's just her.

[Alex] 17:57:25
Is she… yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:27
I swear, I swear it's just her, bro.

[Andy Shang] 17:57:28
What the hell?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:57:28
Average, average Chinese.

[Alex] 17:57:30
Not just like Paul, hiring, like, on, like, whatever, and get her to share her screen, and then, like, literally walk her through the steps.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:34
Yeah, dead ass, bro.

[Andy Shang] 17:57:36
Hmm. Yeah.

[annalise] 17:57:36
Lucius? Yeah, it's difficult. I don't think she's ever going to get a messenger.

[annalise] 17:57:37
No, no, no, I… like, she… this has been for Lisa over the past weeks. She's been sending photos, I've been sending it to you guys, even if you see, she went to her actual settings.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:57:44
That's true.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:47
Yeah.

[annalise] 17:57:47
I don't know, it's all in Chinese too, so I'm just trusting her for what it says, but…

[Andy Shang] 17:57:52
What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:52
Can she, like, can they… can she…

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:55
Great Loki, a new account.

[Alex] 17:57:56
Yeah, just do that, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:57:58
Has she… maybe, maybe that's…

[Andy Shang] 17:57:58
Yeah.

[annalise] 17:57:58
Isn't it linked to your phone number?

[Alex] 17:58:00
It's linked to Facebook, and I don't think it's feasible ongoing for her to not be able to use Messenger, you know?

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:01
I think it's linked to your Facebook.

[Andy Shang] 17:58:05
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:05
But you can maybe, like, you don't have to use phone number, I saw it. Or…

[Andy Shang] 17:58:08
To make a new email or something.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:09
Yeah, and you can try, you can try.

[Alex] 17:58:09
I don't think, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 17:58:09
She can use a uni email.

[annalise] 17:58:10
I mean… Yeah, I lost, because she's trying to, like, re-download ass, like, everything, but I mean, if we use Instagram, that means you guys can't look in the chats.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:12
Or you can use Instagram.

[Alex] 17:58:20
Yeah, and she can't see the other charts as well.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:21
Yeah, but is she here?

[Andy Shang] 17:58:21
Instagram.

[annalise] 17:58:21
So, to all of you want to be in the chat?

[annalise] 17:58:23
Yeah, she's in Australia. Last time I tried to help her, she's here. So it's not a, like, VPN connection or anything.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:23
Is she… is she in…

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:25
She's not sure.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:58:31
That's really weird.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:32
It's a fucking skill issue, bro, what the hell?

[annalise] 17:58:33
And yeah, and her… her phone number's also an Australian phone

[Andy Shang] 17:58:34
It actually is. That's crazy.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:37
What? Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:58:37
I think…

[Andy Shang] 17:58:39
Hey, this gold angle, what can I say?

[Alex] 17:58:40
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:40
That's good. Shut up, Andy, shut up, Andy!

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:43
Show your ass up, man.

[Raymond Jiang] 17:58:45
I discovered nothing bad, by the way.

[Alex] 17:58:47
the…

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:47
This was not bad. Okay, we'll talk about Disco later. Okay, Lu Fei-wise, maybe we'll have a meeting with her in person, and then see if we can…

[Andy Shang] 17:58:49
Yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:54
um, like, face it with her.

[Alex] 17:58:54
Valid, valid.

[Samuel Choong] 17:58:57
Just use Instagram. Just use Insta.

[annalise] 17:58:57
I'm sure… otherwise, if you… if you want… if you want her with response, I'll just communicate with her and, like, tell her when we get the link, I'll just send her directly to her.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:03
Yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:06
Yeah, yeah, okay, that's fine. Okay, events is not… not bad. Careers panel…

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:12
First, maybe…

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:13
Um, okay, let's move on to content creation. Andy!

[Andy Shang] 17:59:17
Yes.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:17
If I'm doing 6-7, have you had a meeting with these guys? Or…

[Andy Shang] 17:59:20
So, just grace. She messaged me quite a few times.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:21
Discuss? Okay.

[Andy Shang] 17:59:23
Uh, I think she's back right. Uh, what do we think? Oh, uh, we were discussing when to actually start the first post and what it would be about.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:31
Yup.

[Andy Shang] 17:59:31
And we're thinking, preferably before a week.

[Andy Shang] 17:59:35
So that, if they look up our accounts.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:35
Maybe do the week before a week?

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:38
Why don't we… why don't we, um…

[Andy Shang] 17:59:38
They can see…

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:41
Why don't we make a big post about the con bonding?

[Andy Shang] 17:59:44
Oh, yeah? Oh yeah, then we'd need, uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 17:59:47
Could be good.

[Andy Shang] 17:59:48
what film and material, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:48
You know what I mean? Like, I feel like we'll get…

[Samuel Choong] 17:59:52
I mean, I don't know what… actually, no, Raven, you're the fucking realest person here, bro.

[Alex] 17:59:56
Yeah, Raymond?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:59:57
I mean, okay, wait.

[Alex] 17:59:59
What happened to the Chinese niche you were in? Have you… do you not like that?

[Raymond Jiang] 17:59:59
Let me think.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:02
Well, I mean, I just… bro, like, if that's all… it's like… it's like diversification, you know? Like,

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:08
put all my eggs in one basket, you feel?

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:10
What's this guy talking about?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:12
What do you mean?

[Andy Shang] 18:00:12
Oh, what the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:13
Talking about, like, this is investment strategy, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:16
But to say… to say you failed POF, Bird, to say you failed POF, come on.

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:19
Right. Are you talking about real, it's not for investors, man!

[Andy Shang] 18:00:22
Oh, what?

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:25
But, okay, but what do you think about, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:25
Okay, on some real shit, though, like, I don't know, do we… it kind of depends what direction we want to go in. Like, do we want more funny stuff? Like, we could do, like,

[Andy Shang] 18:00:27
Oh, okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:34
MPC rules that all the other, like, commerce clubs do, but…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:38
There is things just like Don Grab attention, so, like, that's why I don't like it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:40
I think you should try to do something that will get attention, similar to, like,

[Andy Shang] 18:00:43
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:44
Do you guys know Monash Coding?

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:46
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, one of my friends is in Mac. Do you guys know Justin? Oh, for his last name.

[Alex] 18:00:46
Yep. Oh, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah, knock, knock.

[Andy Shang] 18:00:47
Oh, hell no. Oh, no.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:48
Yeah, yeah.

[Alex] 18:00:52
Last name?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:00:52
But I don't know people who are in Mac, but like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:54
Was it… he's, like, in a lot of the reels, but…

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:56
He's just told me, like, a lot of the exposure comes from doing…

[Samuel Choong] 18:00:58
things that aren't necessarily about coding, but they're more…

[Alex] 18:01:02
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:02
Like, out-of-the-box stuff, but then they get people into coding.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:01:05
Makes sense.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:07
Hm, fair enough. Oh, we did a hackathon, we can…

[annalise] 18:01:08
So even with them as well, do they spam?

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:12
Yeah, they spam reels. There's so many reels.

[annalise] 18:01:13
Like, uh, okay, so that's… yeah, so for… especially the week…

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:14
Well, we'd have to… we'd have to spam.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:23
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:25
Yeah. Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:30
Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:30
So, fun posts as well as…

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:32
You can have, like, yeah, have, like, farm pose.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:34
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:36
I mean, you can have it where, like, your reels are funny, and then your posts are, like, normal stuff.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:01:41
Yeah, that's what most clubs here.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:41
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:42
You know what I mean? Like, you're posting to me, oh, we have an event on this day, guys, but then you're always like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:01:49
Yeah, Raymond… let's go behind, this isn't much of a Raymond film as Reels, or some shit like that, like, I don't know.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:54
Fair enough. Okay.

[Andy Shang] 18:01:56
And we're probably looking at bi-weekly or weekly reels.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:00
Bi-weekly would be ideal.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:02
First real idea, guys, rocking up to Urweave just so I can get all the free shit from the Souls.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:02
What is…

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:07
Your idea could be Yukoni on the first years, bro.

[Alex] 18:02:07
Okay, then.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:10
type shit. Okay.

[Alex] 18:02:11
Yo! Do that, do that, do that, do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, do that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:11
Jaffe Hunting.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:13
pop off.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:13
A poise, okay, pause, okay, pause.

[Alex] 18:02:16
I'll film for you, Raymond.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:17
Yeah, we will all film for you, Raymond.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:18
For what?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:20
For what?

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:23
Nah's.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:23
They're asking.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:25
Yo, you can hear on the Japanese and then fuck off to China, bro.

[Alex] 18:02:28
Yeah, then it's like, what's the…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:29
Wait, zero consequences! Buffett…

[Alex] 18:02:31
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:32
Oh… shit.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:33
Oh my god.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:33
That's crazy. But I hope he's meeting notes don't leaked. Like…

[Alex] 18:02:38
This is being transcribed, by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:38
Okay, um…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:40
This is really smart, actually. Wait, is it? Oh, shit.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:40
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:40
Yeah, it is.

[Alex] 18:02:44
Yes, sir!

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:44
Is biweekly, like, once every two weeks, or twice a week?

[Alex] 18:02:47
Yeah, no, no, no, every two weeks, every two weeks.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:48
twice a week. Oh.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:50
I meant twice a week, then.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:51
Twice a week, right? That's what I was thinking as well.

[Andy Shang] 18:02:52
Yeah, twice a week.

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:53
Twice a week is a bit… you can try it twice a week,

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:55
Shiva. Yeah, I mean, we can have a bunch of low-effort ones, sorry, it wouldn't he?

[Andy Shang] 18:02:58
Yeah. Like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:02:58
Twice a week is a bit ambitious, though.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:02:59
It won't

[Andy Shang] 18:03:01
20-second ones, 10-20 second ones.

[Andy Shang] 18:03:03
Yep.

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:04
Yeah, you can make it try. Um…

[Andy Shang] 18:03:05
Yeah, well, I'll confirm with Grace. Should be fun.

[Andy Shang] 18:03:09
At least one awakened.

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:11
I'm just gonna, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:12
Wish I could make the rules, bro. I mean, jerk.

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:14
Hell no.

[Andy Shang] 18:03:14
You can make the rules.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:15
Yeah, but, like, I… like, I can't…

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:16
Do we want him making the wheels, though?

[Alex] 18:03:17
You could make them in China.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:17
But do you… yeah, but, like, what kind of stuff could I make that, like…

[Alex] 18:03:22
I don't know, find some friends that you could get to film you doing things?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:23
bigger work.

[Andy Shang] 18:03:23
There's too many a room myself.

[Alex] 18:03:25
Related?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:25
Yeah, but, like, but how's this got to do with, like, a Basin Unimoba and something, like…

[Alex] 18:03:29
Well, look at the B1 ones, they weren't even related. It'd be like, oh, when you get aired in the group chat, and then they got 80,000 likes, boom.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:34
I also need, like, I also need, like, friends and shit to be there, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:37
No, I don't think RAM can do shit, though.

[Alex] 18:03:38
Are you saying you're not gonna make friends in China?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:41
Obviously, I'm not, the fuck, like…

[Andy Shang] 18:03:42
What the fuck?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:43
I'm just gonna… I'm just gonna be a little

[Alex] 18:03:43
Then why?

[Andy Shang] 18:03:45
What? Oh my god.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:45
bro, I'm just gonna do my own thing, bro. Be alone, like a Sigma lone wolfer.

[Alex] 18:03:50
Is that actual?

[Andy Shang] 18:03:50
What the hell?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:50
Sigma Alpha. Is it…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:03:52
That's what she expected, by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:52
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's move on, let's move on. Let's move on. I think Mark, I think concentration's done.

[Samuel Choong] 18:03:58
projects. Okay, me and Michael talked to Nina.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:03
Bro, you know Nina turned down an offer from UC Berkeley to come to Uni Melbourne?

[Andy Shang] 18:04:06
What the fuck?

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:07
Alright, what is it?

[Alex] 18:04:07
Yo!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:08
W, W Choice! W Choice.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:09
Oh, when she said that to me, I was like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:11
What the hell? I was just like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:12
Oh, shit.

[Alex] 18:04:12
Yeah, yeah, I agree, what the hell?

[Andy Shang] 18:04:13
A retarded choice, by the way.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:14
the uni for real.

[Alex] 18:04:16
No, she didn't, but that's okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:17
Pick the better uni.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:17
But… you say in that moment because Unibel was probably your only option, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:23
It's a…

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:23
UC Berkeley, right?

[Andy Shang] 18:04:24
No, it actually is Raymond. It was the only offer you got.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:27
It's the only one I applied for, though. That's, like, 100% win rate.

[Andy Shang] 18:04:31
cry about it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:32
Okay, uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:04:32
It's 100% win rate, by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:34
I think our plan is 71,

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:37
We are gonna do, like, more workshop-based… so this is, Annalise, when you were talking about workshop, this is why…

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:42
We had a bit of a… I had, like, I was thinking about it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:45
She wants to run, like, workshops within her projects group.

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:50
So, like, what the plan would be is you do workshops,

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:55
into, like, workshops, into training, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:04:59
Which he trains up all the PCs, or whatever they call it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:02
And then from there, you do, like, mini-tests, et cetera, like coding tests, building things up.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:08
whatever, right? And then you go onto…

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:11
outreach, and then working on an actual project.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:16
um… with the actual, like, with a client.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:18
You know what I mean? So I think it'll be, like, a year-long…

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:22
Because you know how usually, after every sim, we change over?

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:26
I think this one potentially would be for the whole year.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:30
Where, in the first half of the sim,

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:32
You do a lot of training, coding workshops, whatever, like, creating AI, shit like that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:37
And then, later on, we do reach out to, like, companies, and then we set out projects.

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:44
What do you guys think of that?

[Alex] 18:05:46
Yeah.

[annalise] 18:05:49
So is this all for the projects, the people that you're going to be recruiting, or is this open?

[Samuel Choong] 18:05:57
It's just for projects, it's just for projects. It's not open for anyone.

[annalise] 18:05:58
To anyone. Right. So how many people were you thinking about.

[annalise] 18:06:06
actually recruiting for projects, then.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:07
I think… I think it'll be 5.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:10
506.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:12
It's up to Nina. For some reason, I thought there was another co-director that she had, but I guess not.

[Andy Shang] 18:06:13
You know?

[Andy Shang] 18:06:18
Oh, because we sacked Jay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:19
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:21
Fair enough. No…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:26
I've got no pushback from there.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:27
But, um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:29
I guess, like, later on in future semesters, we can hire more leads, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:34
directors, right? Or project leads.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:37
And then they can have more people. But for now, I think it'll be…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:41
One, only for the people that we hire.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:42
And two, you know…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:44
Only up to, like, 5 people, because I don't know…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:47
how many people Nina will want to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:49
like, the leader in the team, like, if it was me, I'm not trying to lead a team of 10 people by myself, you know.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:54
Right, that's just too much. So I think she said 5 is good.

[Samuel Choong] 18:06:57
And I don't disagree with that, I think 5 is fine as well.

[Andy Shang] 18:07:01
That's fair.

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:04
Um, do you guys have anything else to add, or anything I should tell Nina?

[Andy Shang] 18:07:12
Oh, about my idea from last time, did you tell her that?

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:17
Ooh!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:07:18
But what was the idea?

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:20
Ooh! Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:07:22
Why are you going like, ooh, what's happening, guys?

[Alex] 18:07:24
Yeah, what was that?

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:26
Finding at the iShow speed face right now, bro. No, I should… I did try to tell her, but…

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:32
because Michael is more familiar with… I know the idea is, right, it's like,

[Andy Shang] 18:07:35
Yeah. We…

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:36
you'd set them weekly tasks, and then they post about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's a good idea. Uh, but Mark…

[Andy Shang] 18:07:38
weekly case studies, basically.

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:42
Well, Michael, every meeting he's come in, he's straight muted, bro. He works on Saturdays for some reasons.

[Andy Shang] 18:07:46
What the fuck?

[Alex] 18:07:47
Yo, what?

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:47
it doesn't come at all in our meetings, he's just typing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:49
So, we didn't really get to communicate it well with her.

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:53
But I think that we can incorporate it.

[Andy Shang] 18:07:56
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:56
You know how I was talking about, like, the trainings that they're gonna be doing?

[Samuel Choong] 18:07:59
the trainings that they can be doing can be the case studies as well, and then you can post about it.

[Andy Shang] 18:07:59
Oh, yeah.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:02
Oh yeah, that's perfect, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:03
But I need to mention it to her. Honestly, you can… have you…

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:08
Right, who actually knows Nina here? Like, I don't know, I've never met her before.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:12
I mean, I… again, I did one group assignment with her, but, like, it's not like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:14
Okay, well…

[Alex] 18:08:15
Oh, so you probably know her very well, then, compared to everyone.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:17
Yeah, we're best, we're best seeds for…

[Andy Shang] 18:08:17
Very well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:19
Yeah. Uh, okay, Raymond, if you want, not Raymond, Raymond, Andy, Andy, if you want, you can join one of our meetings.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:23
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:25
And then you can, like, explain it.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:26
Sure.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:27
to her and see what she thinks. Because I think it'll sound best when you explain it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:32
you know, because I think it's a good idea.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:33
Sure, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:35
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:39
Because it also is good for marketing.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:41
Yeah, if we can have, like, weekly posts about them.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:43
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:45
This idea?

[Andy Shang] 18:08:47
Bro, I told you before, I said.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:48
Oh, actual, uh, MD.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:50
Raymond's locked out, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:51
get this guy out of the meeting room.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:52
But guys, I thought of an insane reel idea, it's like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:08:55
Hell nah.

[Andy Shang] 18:08:55
Oh, no.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:56
No, no, no, no, hear me out, hear me out.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:08:58
Going to China for exchange and life is good,

[Raymond Jiang] 18:09:01
Except this nerve business analytics analytic Society.

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:04
Yeah, he's gonna film me, bro. Is Andy gonna be filming for you? Like…

[Alex] 18:09:05
do that.

[Andy Shang] 18:09:06
There definitely is, by the way.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:09:06
Type C. Type… uh…

[Andy Shang] 18:09:09
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:09:10
He literally said he would. Andy, you usually said you would, remember?

[Andy Shang] 18:09:13
Oh, I did! Oh, no. Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:09:14
Because you said you'd help, like, be my cameraman and shit.

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:17
Yeah, I need to want to be a calendar member.

[annalise] 18:09:19
What I'm just trying to join on my laptop, can you connect it

[Andy Shang] 18:09:21
Oh yeah, sure.

[Andy Shang] 18:09:25
Uh, next. Sponsorships.

[Andy Shang] 18:09:29
How we went off, Darren?

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:30
Uh, not yet, I think, okay, what we're doing right now is we are building up…

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:35
These cells… not cells, why do I think…

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:36
the sponsorships. Oh yeah?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:09:36
Wait, are we… are we cooked for a week, by the way? Like, with the equipment or whatever?

[Alex] 18:09:42
But what equipment do we need?

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:43
We just need a table, though.

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:45
Nope. Wait…

[Alex] 18:09:46
Mm-hmm, nope.

[annalise] 18:09:46
mail? So then we have no, because it's already past the due date, because I looked at it the other day. And again, that's what I've been trying to say. There's been an email before with about three forms. I really don't mind filling them in, but I don't know what days and people. There's like different events that we should go to.

[Samuel Choong] 18:09:50
Yeah…

[Alex] 18:10:03
Oh, yeah, because it's Monday and Tuesday.

[Alex] 18:10:06
And Wednesday.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:06
I think the FBE one, we should probably all go, or whoever is here will probably go.

[annalise] 18:10:06
Yes.

[Andy Shang] 18:10:09
Yeah, yeah.

[Alex] 18:10:10
I'll be around, yup.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:11
Yeah, I think we'll all go. It's the FPE.

[annalise] 18:10:12
Except for Monday, because I can't go Monday.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:14
I'll make Marco together.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:10:16
Look at the FE ones, like, more important anyway, I feel like.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:17
Yeah, FE is my important. Uh…

[annalise] 18:10:21
There are about 3 of those forms.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:22
Okay, why don't we… why don't we…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:25
like you finish off the…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:26
check-ins first, and then we'll delve into the emails, and then we can, like…

[Alex] 18:10:28
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:30
planned it out. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:33
But, Teresa, Michael, and I are just building up the…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:37
like the sponsorship prospectives. I don't know, if you guys don't know, it's like a…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:40
Uh, like, a little document that you send out to companies, and you give them packages that they can subscribe to, and, like, why they should, you know, sponsor us.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:48
And what kind of benefits I'll get from sponsoring us. So, we're just building that up right now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:53
I think we've set a date for it to be finished.

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:57
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:10:59
like, end of March…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:00
to early April.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:02
Just because…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:05
there's a lot of stuff you have to do for it. If you want, you can have a look at the sponsorships document in the SharePoint.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:11
I've uploaded a few examples of what they are.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:14
at the prospectus. It's a really fat-ass document that just details every event that we do, uh, where sponsors can get involved,

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:23
where the money will be used, what…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:24
packages of art. It's a lot of things that we kind of have to flush out.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:29
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:30
But, like, we're getting… we're starting on it. It's not… it's not too bad.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:33
And I think…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:36
Um, yeah, I don't know, that's about it. We haven't really talked about anything else. I think…

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:41
Theresa asked, because she wants to make it on Canva Pro, is it… how do we get Canva Pro?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:11:46
ACNC, ACNC.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:46
For free.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:48
As you can see? Okay.

[Alex] 18:11:49
Bruh.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:52
Oh, totally, I said, we just have to wait for ACNC to reply back to us then.

[Alex] 18:11:54
I don't think that's… it's not gonna happen until, like…

[Alex] 18:11:57
a month from now, a minimum.

[Samuel Choong] 18:11:58
I think that's okay, though, because, like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:01
the… I think the…

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:03
prospectus itself, I think the hardest thing is just getting all the information. Like, the design is secondary.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:09
You can design it, like, design's easy to do. I think instead of actually getting all the information, like,

[Alex] 18:12:11
Pretty quick, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:14
flushing out all the packages, what events we'll be doing…

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:18
um, you know, etc.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:19
So, don't worry about the ACNC stuff.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:22
For now, I think, like, we can hopefully afford to wait, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:25
Hopefully, we can afford to wait for it. I don't think it's too pressing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:30
Um…

[Alex] 18:12:30
No, it would be good to, before recruitment ends, so they can do the emails and stuff easy, like, right at the start, but…

[Alex] 18:12:36
It doesn't really matter.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:36
Yeah, but, like, if we don't get it, it's like, you can't, I don't know, there's not much we can do, right? Like, we can't really…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:12:41
the emails aren't even that important right now anyway, since we just use Messenger.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:44
Hmm. We can't… can we email them?

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:46
ACNC, probably not, like… they're probably gonna be like,

[Alex] 18:12:48
No, I don't think that they would…

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:49
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:12:50
uh, like, I can't lie.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:12:51
I think the problem is there's just a lot of applications as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:53
Yeah. You know, that's a guy.

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:56
Your response is looking right. I'll…

[Samuel Choong] 18:12:59
Alex, maybe you and I can talk later about the monster stuff, and I can…

[Alex] 18:13:02
Yeah, I could literally give you the email right now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:03
talk to Theresa about it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:06
Okay, sure. We'd be pretty happy to.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:08
Uh, so we move on to recruitment now.

[Alex] 18:13:13
Yep.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:13
Okay, how do we… I think…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:17
Theresa and I and Mark have been talking about it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:20
I suggested that…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:23
We kind of have it, like, first you have, like, your…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:26
Google Doc fill out. It was just the normal questions, but within this fill-out, I said,

[Alex] 18:13:30
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:31
we should have the penny on the roll that you choose.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:34
you should have role-specific questions, do you know what I mean?

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:38
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:13:39
and, like, for, like, marketing or whatever, like, portfolio as well. It's like, should be…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:13:42
Yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:44
Um, okay, I think… what do you guys think of that, though? Apart from Raymond?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:13:47
I'm happy with that.

[Andy Shang] 18:13:48
Yeah, that's good.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:48
Yeah. Yeah, I was happy with that? Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:50
And then 2 will be, like, group interviews.

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:53
I think here…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:56
I'm just thinking…

[Samuel Choong] 18:13:59
Groot interview-wise, maybe projects might be a bit different.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:01
I think Nina… Andy, maybe you can do this too, if you really want. They want to do, like, a case study in the interview.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:06
But not like a consulting case study, but like a… a coding one.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:07
Okay.

[Alex] 18:14:10
Yo! Yo!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:11
Whoa, whoa!

[Andy Shang] 18:14:11
A coding case study? Oh, technical interview, let's go.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:13
like an actual technical, because…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:13
Whoa, chill!

[Andy Shang] 18:14:14
Let's go, let's go.

[Alex] 18:14:15
Hey, y'all!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:15
No, it's too much, guys.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:16
Because I think…

[Alex] 18:14:17
No, no, you can, you just have to, like, write in the application that we're looking for people for projects specifically to have some sort of experience.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:17
Really good questions.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:23
Because I think that's… that's the only difference, because projects is…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:25
That's how we get the best recruits, low-key.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:27
I don't know if it's coding, but like, you know, there'll be a lot of, like, technical in that.

[Alex] 18:14:31
Uh, yeah, 100%, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:31
Do you know what I mean? So…

[Andy Shang] 18:14:31
Yeah. Cool. Leak code, let's go.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:33
Yeah…

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:35
I told her Nina about it more.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:36
COVID

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:37
my dead asses be like, they bring their laptops in, and they all start fucking coding in an FBE project room, bro, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:42
But that'd be… that'd be cooler, honestly. That'd be cool.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:43
Oh my god. Oh, hell yeah.

[Alex] 18:14:44
Can they use cursor for that? Is that off the table?

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:45
That would be pretty cool.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:46
No.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:48
Use what?

[Andy Shang] 18:14:49
technical interview.

[Alex] 18:14:49
CASA.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:50
Let's cursor.

[Alex] 18:14:51
It's like AI writes everything for you.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:51
It's the…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:52
Or he doesn't know, or he doesn't know.

[Andy Shang] 18:14:54
AI coding assistant, basically.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:56
Oh, like, clearly. Yeah, right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:14:58
Uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:14:58
No, no, no. Wait, really?

[Andy Shang] 18:14:58
Yeah, sure.

[Alex] 18:15:00
they actually.

[Andy Shang] 18:15:00
It, like, autocompletes your…

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:00
Is it like the guy…

[Andy Shang] 18:15:02
Code.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:03
Ah. Um…

[Alex] 18:15:04
like, they use cursor at lots of…

[Alex] 18:15:07
places like Stripe,

[Alex] 18:15:09
And bloody, even ChatGBT uses it, I think.

[Andy Shang] 18:15:12
They can use cursor after they join the team.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:12
Oh, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:12
Cusses are… cusses are pee.

[Andy Shang] 18:15:15
But I need to know how to code first.

[Alex] 18:15:16
True.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:16
I don't know, I'll flush it out more with Nina, but I think coding is relatively important.

[annalise] 18:15:19
question, but I mean also did we test Nina in her interview if she could code?

[Alex] 18:15:20
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:21
That makes sense, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:26
Kia knows she concurred from the… from the group assignment.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:27
Yeah, I need an intern for a whole year at an AI tech startup in the States.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:32
I think she can code.

[Alex] 18:15:33
What's her last name again?

[annalise] 18:15:34
So, yeah, but then also, like, for all of the other recruitments, I mean, it's mainly going to be first years, right?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:37
Rover…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:40
Doing a cheeky stalk-out licks.

[Alex] 18:15:42
LinkedIn.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:42
Projects, I don't know about projects, that's the thing.

[Andy Shang] 18:15:42
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:45
Because we…

[Alex] 18:15:45
She doesn't have LinkedIn.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:46
We look at what experience we win projects.

[Andy Shang] 18:15:47
Uh… second…

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:48
Yeah…

[Andy Shang] 18:15:50
Okay, we could get Jay back then.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:51
Oh, come on, Andy, let it die, bro, let it die, let it die.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:56
Pack it up, pack it up.

[Samuel Choong] 18:15:57
Even if I haven't seen packet up, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:15:59
and let me begin. I could not pack it in. Let me begin.

[Andy Shang] 18:16:03
Alright, then maybe coding to you?

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:04
Um, recruitment-wise for projects, I don't think we won first years.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:07
we were thinking of also having, like, a…

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:10
Okay, this, um, I'm not too sure about, but like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:14
Maybe they upload… not their academic transcript, but we need to see, like, their Phobos score or something like that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:20
like, foundations of business analytics.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:21
What, Furbock?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:23
Oh, right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:24
Like, like, maybe there's, like, a minimum requirement of, like, you have to get above 70.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:27
Or something like that. Just so, like…

[Andy Shang] 18:16:29
That's fair. Cool.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:30
True. Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:31
you're able to hire and…

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:33
tell people that this is not…

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:36
an easy role, perhaps, you know.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:38
But I think we'll flush it up. I… I don't know, first year-wise…

[Andy Shang] 18:16:38
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:41
I think first is we'll slot into every other team.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:44
what projects… I don't know.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:46
I feel like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:47
Are you set on making projects, like, at least, like, second year and above?

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:50
Yeah, maybe second year above.

[Alex] 18:16:51
Oh, so we just make it, like, a requirement at age 2 or above, and…

[Alex] 18:16:55
bit of Foundations of Business Analytics.

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:56
Yeah, maybe.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:57
Yeah. But whatever…

[Samuel Choong] 18:16:58
But I'll talk to Nina more about it.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:16:59
I mean, there could be a lot of people that qualified that didn't do…

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:02
Yeah, that's the thing. That's why we don't necessarily have to do…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:17:03
that subject, even.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:07
the fiber thing, but we probably have, like, a technical case.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:10
That would be a good indicator.

[Andy Shang] 18:17:11
Yeah. We can just ask for WAM.

[annalise] 18:17:11
I mean… Yeah, we… Were you looking at… like, were you looking just for coding? Or, I mean, we are business analytics. Do you also want people in your projects who are good at communicating? I feel like if you have five coders.

[Alex] 18:17:12
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:14
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, asking my was a bit dangerous.

[Andy Shang] 18:17:16
Oh, we did that last time.

[annalise] 18:17:28
It's a bit risky.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:29
I mean, I don't think it's that risky.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:32
I mean, are you just assuming that the stereotype of creating is that they can't communicate?

[Andy Shang] 18:17:32
There can be coding and a case study.

[annalise] 18:17:36
Yep. Yep. Yeah.

[Alex] 18:17:36
Yeah, no, but there's… that's kind of valid, though.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:38
Shit, bruh. Yo, yeah, I saw Andy codes a lot here, no?

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:43
Yeah, Michael, wait, okay, whoa, whoa, I don't… I don't agree with that stereotype, because Michael codes a lot.

[Andy Shang] 18:17:43
Right, called every day. My GitHub committed insane.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:49
And Mahu communicates with me every day.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:51
Loud and clear.

[Andy Shang] 18:17:52
Michael… Michael can call for shit.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:53
Really? I saw Michael Codes so much, bro. That guy tells me about his coding.

[Samuel Choong] 18:17:57
But I think…

[Andy Shang] 18:17:57
And it's like, all he does is make AI agents.

[annalise] 18:17:58
I'm thinking about the majority, majority, not minority.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:00
But, like, that's… I mean, that's why we have the interviews, like, we don't…

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:05
Because if you think about project-wise,

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:08
When you have projects for a company, I felt most of their…

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:13
questions, or what they would need help with is…

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:15
maybe coding to an extent, like, it's… yes, you're gonna have to be good at communication.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:20
But…

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:22
It's relatively easy to teach communication within a team. And it's also easier, like, when you have your group

[Andy Shang] 18:18:25
I guess another stamp.

[Alex] 18:18:27
Guys, Chris Lou just started following the Bass account.

[Andy Shang] 18:18:30
Oh, shit.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:18:31
Michael probably told him to, no car.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:32
Nice.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:33
When you have your… when you have your group

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:35
And your behavioural interviews, you can kind of tell who's shit at communicating or not.

[Andy Shang] 18:18:39
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:39
So…

[Alex] 18:18:39
Yeah, I agree.

[annalise] 18:18:41
Do you… are all of the projects coding based? That's what I what I'm mainly.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:44
Well, we only have one project, though.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:47
I really only have one project team.

[annalise] 18:18:48
Oh, so you're not even gonna, like… okay, right, so it's gonna be, like, one stem, and you're just making it better and better for the whole year?

[Andy Shang] 18:18:55
Oh wait, but my training…

[Andy Shang] 18:18:57
Case study idea doesn't have any coding.

[Samuel Choong] 18:18:59
It doesn't? That's fine.

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:01
I mean… wait, what do you… wait, what do you… I don't know, sorry, explain. Can you explain in your mind? So I'm kind of confused right now.

[Andy Shang] 18:19:02
That can be a subtask.

[annalise] 18:19:08
I'm confused with what you… what do you want from the projects? Like an actual example of a project? What do you want?

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:12
A project is… is the team of 6 people,

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:17
Director and 5 PCs.

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:18
going to a company and helping them out on a BA side.

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:22
Whether that be helping them analyze, like, their behind the scenes of, like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:27
Using code to analyze their sales analytics or their customer…

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:31
profiles, or whether that be helping them, like, build a website or things like that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:37
Michael and I talked about. Like, it's helping them using VA.

[Samuel Choong] 18:19:40
By helping non-for-profits, or just helping any type of company that we can.

[Andy Shang] 18:19:45
data announcers?

[annalise] 18:19:45
Right, and then are we going to be able to use this for the rest of the club?

[annalise] 18:19:50
Is this going to be able to… are we going to be able to have, like, an expo for this? Maybe… Or… or like maybe something, an event, we're bringing those people who they were working with.

[Andy Shang] 18:19:55
Expo.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:02
Yeah, yeah, you definitely can. I mean…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:04
If you have them as a contact already in your working with them, I'm sure they'd be happy to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:09
you know, like, come to an expo with you, or…

[annalise] 18:20:11
Because to me, it just…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:13
or showcase the project they've been doing, or even having the team itself just showcase the work that they've been doing.

[annalise] 18:20:19
Right. Just to me, it sounds like, yeah, if you're just going off to work for them, then we're just hiring 5 interns to do unpaid work.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:25
Alice, have you done a project-side work before, though?

[annalise] 18:20:30
No, that's why I'm asking.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:31
Okay, I think…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:34
like, project side, a lot of it is just unpaid work as internship.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:39
And you get the experience, and unless… yes, you're gonna have an expert, but usually you just have a sh…

[annalise] 18:20:39
Oh, right. Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:44
project showcase of, you know, like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:47
team members showing off the work that they've been doing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:50
You know, you don't, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:52
Realistically, if you think about it,

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:55
We're not in a position to be…

[Samuel Choong] 18:20:57
asking for things. As a uni club.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:00
you know, like, the companies that we're working with,

[annalise] 18:21:01
Oh, yeah, of course.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:03
have no reason to work with us, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:06
way of fucking banging that. So, we can't be asking them.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:09
For a lot, a lot of things, like, oh, come to the showcase.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:13
Uh, make sure you post us on your socials, make sure you do this, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:16
We can't really be picky with what they give us, like, we just have to do the work with them, and then show it off to external sponsors, like, hey, we worked on two projects this year with…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:25
This company and that company, and this is what we were able to get out of it, or… you know, we were able to help increase revenue by, like, I don't know, 10%, or we were able to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:33
you know, cut down, like, website lag, or, you know, whatever it is. But a lot of it is…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:38
We do the work?

[annalise] 18:21:40
Yeah, building a portfolio for Bass. Right, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:40
Yeah. Yeah, basically.

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:47
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:49
Do we want to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:21:51
continue talking about recruitment.

[Alex] 18:21:54
I think we should do to get down the timeline of when it's starting, when it's ending, when we'll do interviews, and then from there, I think we're fine for now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:00
I think, uh, interviews-wise…

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:07
like… wait, when's O-Week?

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:08
Is it 22nd to 28?

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:11
It is right.

[Alex] 18:22:12
No, no, no, uh…

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:13
of Feb. Okay, 22nd, 28.

[annalise] 18:22:13
Last week of Feb, last week of Feb.

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:16
Maybe aim to do recruitment interviews from…

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:21
1st of March the 14th.

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:23
Or do you think that's… because when's the… wait, when's the trade again?

[Alex] 18:22:25
I think…

[Alex] 18:22:27
20th to 22nd, so we'd want the recruitment to be done within 2 weeks of that.

[Alex] 18:22:33
I think usually… well, not usually, actually, sorry. What I've often seen is usually… I'm using the word usually. Anyways, usually the recruitment starts at the start of a week, end at the end of the first week.

[Alex] 18:22:44
And then the interviews are done early second week.

[Alex] 18:22:47
And then decisions by the end of that second week, that's what I saw.

[Alex] 18:22:51
So we could do that, and then…

[Samuel Choong] 18:22:52
Okay, that's true.

[Alex] 18:22:54
Wait, if I pull up the calendar, what that then means is applications open 23rd,

[Andy Shang] 18:22:55
Okay.

[Alex] 18:23:00
close, like, the 6th of March, and then we review on the weekend.

[Alex] 18:23:04
interviews anywhere on, like, the 9th, 10th, or 11th of March, and then the decision's out by the…

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:04
Hmm.

[Alex] 18:23:10
12th or 13th.

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:12
Yeah, I'm happy with that. Wait, can you…

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:15
Just reset, so I can type it down.

[Alex] 18:23:17
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, so applications from 23rd of Feb to, like, 6th of March.

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:19
My bad.

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:24
Okay.

[Alex] 18:23:26
Um, and then interviews anywhere from, like, the 9th to 11th of March.

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:33
Do you think that's too short of a… are we doing online or in person?

[Alex] 18:23:38
I think in person could be better.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:23:39
I would think in person, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:41
Um… is that enough time?

[Alex] 18:23:43
I think it should be, in the sense of we'd have…

[Alex] 18:23:47
the group ones, potentially, on one day, and then the individual the next, or we do, like, group then individual, but either way, we can have multiple of them at the same time.

[Alex] 18:23:56
like, obviously, will not just have us interviewing some directors as well. You don't need more than, say,

[Samuel Choong] 18:23:58
Uh…

[Alex] 18:24:02
two of us in an interview.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:04
Okay.

[Alex] 18:24:05
Having got enough bookings for, like, rooms and stuff.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:06
Can we do… can we do, maybe, 9th?

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:09
9th to 12th? Maybe you get, like, an extra buff a day?

[Alex] 18:24:12
Yeah, yeah, let's do that. Yep.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:13
I think 9 to 12 or 9th at the, like, the Monday…

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:16
Thursday and Monday to Friday.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:18
I think… I just feel like we need a bit more time, because if other equipment is going on.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:24
We need… we don't know what the applicant's availability is going to be like.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:28
So then, if we don't give enough time…

[Alex] 18:24:28
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:31
then a lot of them might just straight drop out.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:33
Hopefully they don't, but like…

[annalise] 18:24:35
I think we should also see one inflow of how many applicants we get, and we can always book more rooms and cancel them later.

[Alex] 18:24:41
We're better off to book them now, because

[Alex] 18:24:43
Every single club will be trying to take all those rooms, unless we just, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:44
Yeah…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:24:46
Yeah, no, literally.

[annalise] 18:24:47
Yeah, exactly.

[Alex] 18:24:48
Don't go for project rooms and book classrooms. Could do that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:52
Classroom's… you can book Classums?

[Alex] 18:24:53
I've got the thingo for it, if we want to use that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:54
Shit.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:24:55
Uh, he's got the finger for it, so it should…

[Samuel Choong] 18:24:58
Are you Tudor, or is it because you're exec?

[Alex] 18:24:59
No, it's from execs. I think we should all have it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:02
Oh, okay, that's calm. And then I guess DLIBs will be from the 14th to the 15th.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:07
Oh

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:10
Wait, yeah?

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:10
14th to 15th.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:13
sounds about right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:13
Um…

[Alex] 18:25:14
And we'd probably have to do induction, like, the Tuesday, and then that means that turnaround is kind of crazy, though.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:16
Yeah…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:19
Are you guys… are you guys gonna plan something for induction as well?

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:22
Yeah, we use Zooming in, Raymond.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:23
We'll just make it true.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:25
Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, obviously, but, like, what are you guys gonna do?

[Alex] 18:25:26
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:29
Show them your reels, bro. Nah, I think we'll plan induction soon.

[Alex] 18:25:34
That's something that's got to be done.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:34
I think that's a good idea, though, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:37
I mean, keep in mind, maybe when you can plan adoption, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:40
Blur key, call it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:42
Mm-hmm.

[Alex] 18:25:44
No.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:44
Yeah, Scarlett, well, you're not even there, yeah?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:25:46
Well, I mean, you guys can go, like, I don't have to be there.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:50
Okay, we can… we can have a think about induction.

[Alex] 18:25:51
I'm pulling up the club booking thing, I want to just see what the availability's like.

[Samuel Choong] 18:25:56
Um, can we also figure out on the technical side for recruitment, like, what?

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:01
what webs… because I know what websites we want to use and stuff like that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:05
like, what platforms we can use to send out mass emails? Because I know…

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:10
180 uses Calendly? I don't know what it's called, but I…

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:13
you can just pick out your time to when you're free, basically.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:17
And you just send out an email, and then, like, here is the available time for an interview.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:21
Uh, and then they just select whatever time is good for them.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:26
But, like, do you guys… like, what do you guys use in that, or MMI?

[Alex] 18:26:26
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:26:29
In BAP, we just straight up called people.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:26:30
For what again? Sorry?

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:32
Just like… just like websites.

[Alex] 18:26:33
And in fact, we didn't even use a website, we just sat down and called people. They do that in FSA as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:39
Oh, yeah.

[Alex] 18:26:40
Just because…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:26:41
Wait, what do you mean?

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:42
Um, like, Raymond, like, for 180, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:45
When you get a good, like, when you get invited to do an interview, they send you an email, and they're like, hey, click on this website link. It's like when to meet.

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:51
But it's more polished, so like, hey,

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:53
Who are the available times to do a meeting?

[Samuel Choong] 18:26:56
Click whichever one suits you, and then you click it, and then that's, like, the time they're booked in for.

[annalise] 18:27:02
Is it first and best roast.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:27:03
Oh…

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:03
Yeah, it's first and best dress. But, like, there'll obviously be enough

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:07
time, slots for everyone to get in, it's just…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:27:09
Well, I saw for MMI, they didn't even give me a choice for time.

[Alex] 18:27:13
Yeah, some of them just say you're doing… if there's a group, an individual, they might just, like, tell you when.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:27:16
Wait…

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:17
I mean, up to you guys.

[Alex] 18:27:17
Because it gets a bit…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:27:18
Well, Licky, let me check, let me check.

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:20
I know… because I know 180 does it, and it's pretty efficient, I would say.

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:24
Because it's just like, you can just see what time each interview is.

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:28
But they also do online interviews, so it might be a bit different.

[Alex] 18:27:31
Do you want to have a look at the room booking thing? Do you want to see what it is?

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:34
Yeah, is it on… is it on my Unimail? Is it just the library website, or is it something else?

[Alex] 18:27:39
No, it's like this random…

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:41
Shoot, can you paste the link?

[Alex] 18:27:43
I'm sharing it right now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:44
Okay.

[Alex] 18:27:44
I think. Could you say it?

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:48
No. Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought, what is this, bro?

[Alex] 18:27:51
Yeah, so 9th to 15th of March.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:27:52
Holy…

[Alex] 18:27:54
It's not for booking, like, project rooms, you book classrooms, so, like, say…

[Samuel Choong] 18:27:55
Is that what you think

[Alex] 18:27:59
I don't know, Kuangli Dao, because I don't think much goes on in there.

[Alex] 18:28:05
Uh, let it think.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:07
Oh, this looks so… I just… what the hell?

[Alex] 18:28:10
We could just munch up a room that has space for 48?

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:14
Yeah. But…

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:18
Wait, is this for group interviews?

[Alex] 18:28:19
Yeah, I'm just… I was just having a look at, like, what we could book, because I bet if we checked dibs, it's all gonna be already full.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:27
No, you can't book this, you can't book on tips yet.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:28:27
For MMI?

[Alex] 18:28:29
Oh, you can't?

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:31
Booking, you can only book 2 weeks in advance.

[Alex] 18:28:34
Oh, so if we just, like, hopped on that as two weeks before?

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:37
So you can look at, like, spawn camp that shit, like…

[Alex] 18:28:40
So we might have to do that, then, get everyone, like, to spawn camp it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:42
Yeah. But…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:28:44
I reckon that's a play, honestly.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:45
I mean, that could be the play, but we should have a…

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:48
uh, backup. Like, maybe we just straight, like, kidnapped 3 rooms in Kuali Dao.

[Samuel Choong] 18:28:53
Just for the love of the game.

[Alex] 18:28:53
I could, like, there's a thing for me to book them right now, although I don't think I have this for Bass, I'm pretty sure I have it for BAP. Hold on, let's double check this.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:00
How do you… how do you go on this website, Alex?

[Alex] 18:29:03
Uh, you go on, I'll show you in a sec, there's a way you request it, but say I want us to get, like, 10 till…

[Alex] 18:29:10
10 to 5.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:10
Boy, this is good for our comm meetings then, no, because we just kidnap a whole-ass room.

[Alex] 18:29:14
Oh, wait.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:16
Oh, there's 180? What the heck?

[Alex] 18:29:16
Uh, we're not in there.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:18
Oh, what? Wait, why are we not in there?

[Alex] 18:29:21
Because I think they gotta… I don't know, well, what even is here?

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:24
is 180, right, I'll just book it on the 180, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:26
Wait, is this for FEE?

[Alex] 18:29:29
Business One Consulting, gleam Up.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:31
Wait, is this for… is this, like, only FBE clubs, or…?

[Alex] 18:29:35
This is how they book Notice for anyone.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:37
So, Omsu, is this OMSU affiliate?

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:38
well, why are we not?

[Alex] 18:29:40
Any Amsu Club, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:42
Wait, 180 is not… wait, wait, wait, 180's not OMSU, though.

[Alex] 18:29:46
Uh, I guess it's just any club, then. I don't know.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:46
Yeah, so…

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:48
So why are we not there?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:48
What the hell?

[Alex] 18:29:49
could pretend to be 180.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:51
Yeah, we can potentially, like, can we do, like, AI?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:52
What the fuck?

[Alex] 18:29:53
I probably got it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:55
There's AI on this?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:29:55
Cheeky AHA angle.

[Alex] 18:29:55
Where was that?

[Samuel Choong] 18:29:57
I think I have to go down. Okay, anyway, so you just… you just use this.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:00
Like, you just book through here.

[Alex] 18:30:03
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:04
Okay.

[Alex] 18:30:05
It is called TA Reserve.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:08
Right. Do we have to request it, or do we just hop on?

[Alex] 18:30:10
You request it. I could show you how… that's what I'm trying to find right now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:13
Maybe just send us, you can just send us a link, and then we can do it ourselves.

[Alex] 18:30:15
Yeah, I'll send the link, I'll find it now and share the link.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:18
Um, but yeah, technical-wise, that's what I was talking about the websites and whatnot, like, I don't mind just calling them and being like, hey,

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:25
you're doing the interview at this time, you know, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:27
You just gotta do it. Always just give them a few options to choose from.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:30
What do you guys think?

[annalise] 18:30:33
I remember email and say, like. I mean, it's more for days. Maybe you can ask what day, and then once they give a day, then say that's your time.

[Alex] 18:30:42
Uh, I reckon we'd be better, I mean, up to you guys, but if we… like, the only challenge with, like, leaving it to, like, a website…

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:43
Yeah…

[annalise] 18:30:45
Oh.

[Alex] 18:30:50
Where we're filling in times, is it then means that you essentially have to make sure that you're available every single day for all of the days.

[Samuel Choong] 18:30:57
Yeah, I think that's the thing, we'll probably have, like,

[Alex] 18:30:59
And…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:30:59
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:31:00
a lot of dead zones.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:02
probably… you'll probably just have…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:03
times where we block out that we are free at, you know what I mean?

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:07
Okay, I think we have to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:11
We'll probably figure out our availability quite fast now.

[Alex] 18:31:15
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:15
in terms of, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:19
interviews and whatnot.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:20
So if we find out a time, let's say, like, we all set out, like, 2 or 3 days that we're free to interview,

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:26
Right, then we can just do that. Or even…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:29
not all of us had to be free, because the directors would be here as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:33
usually, I think…

[Alex] 18:31:33
So…

[annalise] 18:31:34
Can we as executives go into any interviews or am I in events or in sponsors?

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:39
I would say it's preferable to just…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:44
interview who you're shadowing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:46
But… do you guys… do you guys have any…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:31:47
Yeah, I agree.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:49
push back against that, because I also don't mind.

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:51
doing any interview.

[Alex] 18:31:52
I'm happy to do any, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:31:53
I mean, me and Andy ain't doing shit, but like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:31:55
Yeah, you have a fucking joking. Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 18:31:56
We can do a Zoom, it's fine.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:31:59
No, I don't think that's the best, I wanna see. I mean…

[Andy Shang] 18:32:00
Alright, well…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:01
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:32:01
If you guys want me to, like, I don't… like, I would, but, like, it

[Raymond Jiang] 18:32:04
you know, in person's usually better.

[Alex] 18:32:06
I reckon it's fine to just keep it within the one, like, that you're looking at, but if we want to have, like, a little bit of crossover, just to, like, I don't know…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:08
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:12
Yeah, we can… we can have it…

[Alex] 18:32:13
sanity check as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:15
We can… we can have it where, like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:18
mostly do the interviews that you're shadowing for, but…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:21
If someone is, like, to fill in, you just fill in, you know.

[Alex] 18:32:24
Yeah, because it's not…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:25
Or we can just have one director.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:28
And then 2 execs. And then, like, you float around.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:32:30
Yeah, I think… I think… oh, wait, you went… you went 3-on-1?

[Alex] 18:32:34
That'll be it, maybe?

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:34
Oh, no, this is for group, this is for group, this is for a group.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:36
I was thinking for good. Group-wise, you can have 3, and then, example, you could have, like,

[Alex] 18:32:37
Oh, for group, yeah, three, yeah, and then one-on-one, do two.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:42
me, Michael, are shadowing spawns.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:32:44
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:44
Maybe Michael and Tuiza do the interview, and then you…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:47
put Raymond in there too, just to have a different…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:32:49
You didn't put me in there, how… or, like, example.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:50
No, no, no, no, no, just to have a different side of… just to have a different, like, perspective, or…

[Alex] 18:32:51
Yep.

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:55
if they're doing content creation, it's Andy, me, and Grace in the interview, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:32:59
So maybe, like, Andy, like I said, you have a fresh perspective, you know?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:33:03
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:33:04
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:04
Just in case. So you're not, like, immediately biased?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:33:08
Yeah. Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:08
towards the thing that you're shadowing. But I think behavioral interviews

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:13
will either just be, like… by the way, when I mean behavioral, I just mean, like, the one-on-one interview after.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:17
Because you should do group, and then a one-on-one.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:33:17
Yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:19
In the one-on-one interview, we can just have it where…

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:22
is the director and exec.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:24
And then the officer. Like, 3-on-1 is crazy. That's some devious work, bro.

[Alex] 18:33:27
Yeah, no, let's not do that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:29
That's a devious way.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:30
Unless it's… unless it's, like, some Hello Webline.

[Alex] 18:33:31
Um…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:33:32
keep it to 2, keep it to 2 for that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:33
Cuba 2 max.

[Alex] 18:33:33
Also, on the questions in the interviews,

[Alex] 18:33:35
I reckon, like, we do…

[Alex] 18:33:38
like, we should… I've already got things we can use, like, I've got one that I made for BAP, it has the questions from, like, FSA and also some people in Sydney, I got some from, like, unit there.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:39
Make HR make it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:43
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:47
Yeah…

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:49
Let's lowkey not GPT this, though. I think the questions have to be…

[Alex] 18:33:53
I can send you what I've got right now. Like, it's a proper document.

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:54
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:33:55
Is it the same? Is it the same stuff as you sent us last time for the directors?

[Alex] 18:33:59
Oh, it's literally that, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:00
Yeah, yeah, I remember that. But I think, just make sure we're doing GPT, especially the recruitment booklet.

[Alex] 18:34:01
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:34:05
Oh, no, that'll be really obvious, yeah, let's not do that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:06
your emphasis, man, don't eat it, bro. Because all the directors are…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:34:09
But I didn't do that, bro, that was Michael, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:12
I thought Markov guy. Well, they all…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:34:12
I didn't even want, like, a recruitment booklet, by the way.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:15
Oh, that's even worse, man. But they're all asking me about the fucking recruitment booklet for directors.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:20
because they were confused about the descriptions.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:23
But, um, we can do that, Alex. We can just steal some questions. Do we want HR to make the interview questions, or do we want…

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:31
Like, do we want HR to make the…

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:33
most of the interview questions, and then each portfolio can make that designated special question.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:34:37
I reckon that's a good idea. It can be…

[Alex] 18:34:38
Yeah, I'm fine with that, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:34:39
We can make all the, like, behavioral questions.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:41
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:34:42
We can just chuck it in a shared dock so everyone's on the same page with what the questions are.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:34:42
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:46
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:54
Uh…

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:56
Loki, can we… let's kill, um, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:34:59
Like, not Roombooking, like, time bookings, like, how do we want to do it? I think it's better to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:03
decide on a way to do it now, instead of prolonging it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:07
from what it sounds like, there's, like, two options. You just use a website,

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:11
Or… we just sort of manually do it and just give them a few…

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:14
like a block of availability that were free, or we give them a time.

[annalise] 18:35:18
Do we first want to book that actual room under, like, a random club? Because we can always cancel that, and then… Good.

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:25
Yeah, I assume you can put them in if you want, if she's on the dates.

[Alex] 18:35:27
It's technically a request, so…

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:30
So requests. I was gonna do the request if you want, I think that's fine.

[Alex] 18:35:32
which club do you want me to put it under?

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:34
So bad. Too bad.

[Alex] 18:35:36
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:35:37
Because we also did… I did this for Baffert, literally, uh,

[Alex] 18:35:41
a couple days ago again, so I'll call it Internal Meeting.

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:44
Yeah. So, like, we can cancel the invoice when I bought.

[Alex] 18:35:46
event…

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:49
FBE room bookings will just have to camp, like, snap it.

[Alex] 18:35:51
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:52
It's like 2 weeks to the time, like, the exact time to when you can book it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:56
So…

[Samuel Choong] 18:35:58
Yeah, everyone gonna… everyone gonna be spamming that shit.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:01
Um…

[Alex] 18:36:02
or a link to advertisement, link to risk assessment, I forgot about that.

[Alex] 18:36:06
I'll do this, I'll do this sometime later, um, because we might have to just hook something up for that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:07
Pro what?

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:09
Okay.

[Alex] 18:36:11
Forgot about that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:12
What do you guys want to do? Do you guys want to do, like, a manual thing, or do you want to use, like, a website?

[Alex] 18:36:15
I would say…

[Alex] 18:36:17
that if we're given we won't be doing, like, loads and loads and loads of interviews.

[Alex] 18:36:23
Unless change might correct me if I'm wrong on that.

[Alex] 18:36:25
it might be a little bit more time efficient.

[Alex] 18:36:28
to just call, because then we can pack them closer together.

[Alex] 18:36:32
But if you guys would rather use a website, just because then we don't have to deal with the, like,

[Alex] 18:36:36
time of calling people.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:38
I'm… I'm pretty happy doing website, just cause…

[Alex] 18:36:39
I would do that as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:41
But this is me personally, I think I'm more biased, because that's what I've…

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:43
done previously, because I know I used to do calling for my other club,

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:47
And it's just annoying when they don't pick up, or if they take it ages to respond.

[Alex] 18:36:50
Oh yeah, good point.

[Andy Shang] 18:36:50
Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:36:51
It was lucky annoying for directors, I ain't gonna lie.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:51
That's the only thing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:53
There's a bit of a…

[Alex] 18:36:53
Okay, do a website, yeah, do a website.

[Samuel Choong] 18:36:55
But we don't… I mean, it doesn't have to be a website, because we can also just do email instead.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:00
Which, you know…

[Andy Shang] 18:37:01
But email back and forth would be horrible to take care of.

[Alex] 18:37:04
Now, I reckon if we're gonna not call, just do the website, and maybe we can set it up such that there's, like, just enough times for the number of people that we're interviewing.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:06
Yeah…

[annalise] 18:37:06
Come in?

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:12
Yeah, yeah.

[Alex] 18:37:13
At first, and it's like, if one of these doesn't work, let us know, and that sort of, like, I guess, actually solves the problem of dead time.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:17
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 18:37:19
Yeah, that's perfect.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:37:19
But you could do it like an availability thing, like, I'm available these times, and then you sort them in.

[Andy Shang] 18:37:24
That is how the website works.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:25
Yeah, yeah. I think that's how the website works.

[Andy Shang] 18:37:28
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:37:28
Our children…

[annalise] 18:37:28
There's no way to do your Outlook calendar, too?

[Alex] 18:37:31
Yeah, like, with the website, it sends the calendar invites out once, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:34
Yeah, it says it's a whatever, like, Google Calendar or Outlook.

[annalise] 18:37:35
Alright. Yeah.

[Andy Shang] 18:37:37
Yeah. Jane Street lets you use this, by the way.

[Alex] 18:37:39
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:37:41
Well, I'm getting water.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:42
And us.

[Alex] 18:37:43
No, no, no water allowed.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:47
Uh, okay, well, I don't mind using the website all either.

[Alex] 18:37:50
Yeah, the website it is… I think that's sorted.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:51
Uh, and then… are we making HR set this up, or are we doing it?

[Alex] 18:37:54
Oh, yeah, yeah, HR setting it up.

[Samuel Choong] 18:37:56
Okay. What's it about? It's called Callan…

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:00
Calendly… yeah.

[Alex] 18:38:00
Calendly.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:02
Shoot, I hope there's not, like, a fucking paywall behind this, that we need, like, ACNC emails for.

[Alex] 18:38:07
Is there…?

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:07
I have no idea. We'll cross that bridge later.

[Alex] 18:38:09
I'm checking. No, that thing literally says free online appointment scheduling, but then you click on it and it's got…

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:13
Okay.

[Alex] 18:38:15
Uh, free for personal use, always.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:18
Yeah, nice. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:25
Okay, let's talk about emails now. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:30
Alright, chew over for Raymond, or should we just talk about it?

[Alex] 18:38:32
I mean, this… is this about, like, setting them up for everyone and stuff like that?

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:36
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is about the emails that we have to reply to, like, the OMSU stuff.

[annalise] 18:38:36
believe in when's Raymond leaving? Yeah, one is… one is driving and leaving?

[Alex] 18:38:41
Ah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:43
And even when leaving.

[Andy Shang] 18:38:45
19th? 20th? Yeah.

[Alex] 18:38:46
Alright.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:47
19th? 20th of March.

[Alex] 18:38:49
No, April. April. April.

[Andy Shang] 18:38:49
Huh? I'm not fend, no.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:50
Hi, April.

[annalise] 18:38:51
Oh.

[Alex] 18:38:52
No, February, I don't know why I said April, sorry.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:54
for… are you… okay. I guess you and…

[annalise] 18:38:56
So you won't… okay, it doesn't matter, he won't be here for any of them.

[Samuel Choong] 18:38:59
Yeah…

[Andy Shang] 18:39:01
I mean, I know.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:03
So, okay, I see the FBE orientation email.

[annalise] 18:39:04
Okay. Uh, it was on the… yeah, they sent it on the Wednesday the 28th of the 1st.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:10
Yeah.

[annalise] 18:39:11
There's three different… registrations.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:14
I know that, okay, for sure…

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:16
I think FPE orientation, we all should go, like, whoever can go should go. Annalise, you have work, that's lowkey fine.

[Alex] 18:39:19
Yeah. Yeah.

[annalise] 18:39:22
Uh, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, I'm working. I mean, yeah, because Wednesday's the Summerfest. I still don't… we still haven't decided who's doing Summerfest, because 90% of people said yes.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:24
That's okay. Don't stress.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:32
Yeah. Okay, well…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:39:33
Sorry, I'm back.

[annalise] 18:39:35
So, like, we can random, we can, I don't know, random wheel it, if we want.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:38
Okay, we'll… we'll do that in a sec. Okay, let's do orientation. Let's Loki just register for it now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:43
I think it's better to get it done now. So, okay, Annalise, if you can't do it, that's fine.

[annalise] 18:39:44
Mm-hmm.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:47
Alex, do you want to register for it?

[annalise] 18:39:50
I can… I have it open, though. I can just… I can fill out the block. I'll share my screen so everyone can see it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:39:51
Okay.

[Alex] 18:39:52
Oh, if you've got it open, yeah, just do it quickly.

[Alex] 18:39:56
How's the water, Raymond?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:39:58
I'm sorry, I just tap water.

[Alex] 18:40:00
You don't have fridge water? Disappointing.

[annalise] 18:40:02
Okay, can you see this?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:40:03
What the fuck, fridge food?

[Alex] 18:40:04
I'm kidding, I'm kidding here.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:40:06
Yeah, I can see it, I can see it.

[annalise] 18:40:07
Okay, okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:40:09
I can also see me, what the hell?

[Alex] 18:40:09
I can also say Raymond.

[Andy Shang] 18:40:14
I don't know.

[annalise] 18:40:16
Okay…

[Samuel Choong] 18:40:19
What is your position for semester? Am I trash?

[Alex] 18:40:24
Oh, do we have to individually, or are you registering for another one?

[annalise] 18:40:27
No, I think it… it said… No, no, no, I'm pretty sure what you said. I've emailed, so please nominate who'll be completing these forms.

[Samuel Choong] 18:40:27
I think it's an individual.

[Samuel Choong] 18:40:30
Is it not?

[Alex] 18:40:34
Uh, you're nominated.

[annalise] 18:40:35
Let's chill.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:40:36
That's true, then.

[Andy Shang] 18:40:40
Well, Loki, I need to dip to another meeting. I'll keep this open, though.

[annalise] 18:40:42
Which will I… Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:40:44
What meaning do you have, Andy?

[Andy Shang] 18:40:46
I have the transcript there, so it's fine.

[Samuel Choong] 18:40:48
What meaning do you have?

[Andy Shang] 18:40:49
So, uh, this random startup.

[annalise] 18:40:49
Um…

[Alex] 18:40:51
called… what's it called? What's it called? What's it called?

[Andy Shang] 18:40:55
It's a Chinese name, bro, it's so…

[Alex] 18:40:57
No, that's okay, so I'll type it out.

[Andy Shang] 18:41:01
No, no, I don't think I will.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:03
actually calling for her.

[Andy Shang] 18:41:04
Okay, I'll keep this open.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:06
top 10… top 10 nicest people of all time, bro, by the way.

[Alex] 18:41:06
I did Chinese till Year 10, have faith.

[Samuel Choong] 18:41:12
Which days will you attend? Monday, Tuesday? Right.

[Alex] 18:41:14
We don't need to do MBS, I don't think that that's worth…

[Samuel Choong] 18:41:16
No, we're not MBS.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:16
Well, it would say, are we? Or Melbourne Business School? Hell no.

[Samuel Choong] 18:41:20
We're not, we're not like that.

[annalise] 18:41:22
Here, I'll just do one. Monday cheese is fun.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:23
One day there, maybe one day.

[Samuel Choong] 18:41:24
Yeah. Is that all we have to do?

[Alex] 18:41:25
I'm all good.

[annalise] 18:41:27
Okay. Now, Form 2. So now, FBE equals Saudi official presidential handover and exec committee swearing in ceremony.

[Samuel Choong] 18:41:28
What the hell?

[Alex] 18:41:36
Oh yeah, that we do need a few to go to that.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:38
Oh, wait, is this… is this the one that I didn't get? It is right.

[Alex] 18:41:44
So, we don't wait… could you go back to the email for a second?

[annalise] 18:41:44
No.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:45
But…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:47
Should they have my email fucked up?

[Alex] 18:41:48
Because we don't all need to go to that one.

[annalise] 18:41:49
Yes. Um, all your executive committees.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:51
Which one?

[annalise] 18:41:55
Oh yeah, that's… yeah, I can come late.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:41:59
But what's this in front? Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:02
not showing off to this guy.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:04
You're not in the country, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:07
Uh, let's say Colin, by the way, even if I were to, like, fly back, I wouldn't be able to re-enter, because my visa.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:12
Oh, really? Damn…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:13
Yeah. It's one-time entry.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:15
Do you have Australian… oh, for China.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:17
No, for China, like, I'm gonna be able to go back.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:20
Get the 10-year visa, bro.

[Alex] 18:42:22
Is that… does that cost more?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:22
Wait, how do I get that?

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:24
Don't you just apply?

[Alex] 18:42:25
Nobody's got a student one, doesn't he?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:27
Yeah, obviously shouldn't be.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:29
Uh, I think we just apply for this, no?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:31
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:32
I said, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:37
Wait, isn't this cooked?

[annalise] 18:42:38
Oh.

[Alex] 18:42:39
The what?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:39
Like, if I'm… like, what are they gonna think of me and Andyon do?

[Alex] 18:42:42
That's fine.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:43
It is what it is.

[annalise] 18:42:44
Is there a Zoom? Like…

[Alex] 18:42:45
No, I don't… it's not that deep, I don't think. If there was something like this in SEM2, and it was kind of chill.

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:48
Don't worry, don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:42:49
Surely not right.

[annalise] 18:42:51
Uh… who wants to… I mean, I can be main contact, but I'm gonna be, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:52
Do you want to be… I can…

[Samuel Choong] 18:42:54
I don't mind. I can… wait, do, do, do Alex Michael Y, since we'll be there on time, probably.

[annalise] 18:43:00
Yeah, so maybe, I think, do you want to… you need to fill in the form then.

[Alex] 18:43:00
Do you want to do it, Sam? Or do you want me to do it?

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:04
I can fill it in.

[annalise] 18:43:05
Actually, oh, yeah, probably easier. Yeah.

[Alex] 18:43:05
Okay, Sam, you do it. Yeah, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:06
I just followed in.

[annalise] 18:43:11
is it… it's gonna be all of the clubs, right? Is it?

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:14
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:43:15
Yeah, it looks like it.

[annalise] 18:43:17
Is it gonna be, like, a one-by-one?

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:18
No way, bro. No, no, no. That's not enough for 2 hours. I feel like you would need, like, 5 hours for all of that.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:43:19
Oh, surely not.

[Alex] 18:43:20
No, no, no.

[annalise] 18:43:24
Yes, ma'am. Okay, so that's… yeah, you can fill in all that.

[annalise] 18:43:32
Um, anything? You can also bring along… oh, yeah, it says you can bring along as many execs as you like, but they must commit to attending.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:43:41
Oh, okay.

[Alex] 18:43:41
Could you double… remind me what the date on it is?

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:41
Uh… okay, Annalise, if… do you want to come? Because if you're going to be late, you don't have to come.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:43:45
What if you guys just locally say, like…

[Alex] 18:43:46
10th of March, let me just… oh, I can definitely go, yeah, I can definitely go.

[annalise] 18:43:47
Because… Like, no, because I… I mean, I work until, like, 5. I could maybe get out, and I'm already in the city, so I could…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:43:48
nobody's going, you know?

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:49
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:43:58
Saphi, because if you'd rather just go home after work, no one's gonna blame you for that.

[Alex] 18:44:01
Yeah, honestly, valid.

[annalise] 18:44:02
Well, what's the event, though?

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:04
Dude, there's probably gonna be some boring-ass FBE event.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:44:08
There'll be free food, though, I'm sure.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:09
soft induction…

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:10
It's probably, like, we all sit down and then listen to them yap.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:14
Boy, like

[Raymond Jiang] 18:44:14
it's like…

[Alex] 18:44:14
And this is where they take the photos with the, um, with the…

[Alex] 18:44:18
Polaroid camera of everyone.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:20
Yeah, it's gonna be so… I mean, look, I personally would not go if I didn't have to.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:23
But it's up to you.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:44:24
It's gonna be peak, it's gonna be peak.

[annalise] 18:44:26
Is it… is it a bad look from us to have only two people?

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:29
No, Michael will be here.

[Alex] 18:44:29
Just… yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:31
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

[Alex] 18:44:32
So we have at least the right.

[annalise] 18:44:32
Oh, they're 3. Oh.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:35
I mean, do you wanna come? If you wanna come, you can come, but if you wanna go home after work as well, I…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:44:35
Yeah, that's true.

[annalise] 18:44:40
No, I really… no, like, I can come, but I'll only be able to… 5.530, probably.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:46
Okay. That's fine.

[annalise] 18:44:49
So I don't know if you have to put that…

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:50
Uh, no, it's fine.

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:53
Nice. Any… any allergies, guys?

[Samuel Choong] 18:44:57
Yeah, it's common, like, I'll submit.

[annalise] 18:44:59
Okay, so you put down… am I… did you put my… down my name?

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:00
Yeah, I put Alex… I'll put Michael.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:03
But sporting Michael in, bro, who cares?

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:05
And then we put you on the list.

[annalise] 18:45:08
Yep, I'll put down the time.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:09
or Jia?

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:11
Does it… does it matter?

[Alex] 18:45:13
Chuck and Michael, I reckon.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:14
Submit. Nice. Third form.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:18
FBE Club Carnival.

[Alex] 18:45:20
I won't be able to go to that one, I'll be in Sydney.

[annalise] 18:45:26
What is this?

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:26
What is this?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:45:27
Wait, what is… what is this club condable thing, bro? I've never seen this before.

[Alex] 18:45:32
They say 500 plus, but I've never… I never heard of it last year, I can't lie.

[annalise] 18:45:33
Stop.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:45:35
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:35
What? Is this where you get the jumpers? No, that's Oweek, though. Wait, what?

[Alex] 18:45:39
Look, I don't know if this is the most relevant event.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:45:42
Is this a real thing, even? I said…

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:44
There's a host of… you can host a pop-up store.

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:46
But is it even worth…

[Alex] 18:45:47
Nah, I reckon…

[annalise] 18:45:48
Well, look, look, look. You will need to attend the club's induction event on the 10th for further information, so it seems like you can explain it.

[Alex] 18:45:53
Could we, like, hold off and wait until we see that to decide?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:45:55
Bob's introduction event?

[Samuel Choong] 18:45:57
No, we just… wait, wait, wait, we just signed up for the induction event already. That was the thing we were talking about just then.

[annalise] 18:45:59
I… Yeah, yeah, but I'm saying it says what this thing is on the 10th, so maybe you…

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:03
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:07
Okay, maybe we just go and then see what it is, and then fill it out later.

[Alex] 18:46:09
Yeah, that's what I think.

[annalise] 18:46:10
Yeah, if it's dead half.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:10
If you want to go? Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:12
Wait, okay, this Loki reply to the… also the AMSu, the AMSU guy.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:16
person about what we need, even though it's a bit late.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:18
It's better to just tell them if we need something. If they say no, it is what it is, but like…

[annalise] 18:46:20
That one…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:24
But I guess we don't need anything other than the table, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:26
Boy, what does a powered site as well? Who… what?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:28
That just means, like, if you, like,

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:31
it has POW outlets in there.

[annalise] 18:46:31
A laptop, laptop. Well, I'm assuming that's what you want to plug in.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:33
Do we need a lab?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:34
laptop.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:39
I guess it's, like, anything that needs electricity.

[annalise] 18:46:39
Brian? Yeah, see, you guys, like… Please let us know by 5pm tomorrow, Wednesday the 4th.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:48
This is really awkward, guys.

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:49
It is what it is.

[Alex] 18:46:50
Did we even need a powered site? Like, what do we have to plug in?

[annalise] 18:46:53
Well, someone… someone booked the powered site.

[Alex] 18:46:55
Yeah, who was it?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:46:57
Well, it would have been Michael then, because he filled out the form, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:46:57
What?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:02
Mike would then.

[Alex] 18:47:04
Cheeky bugger. Just kidding.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:05
Oh, he probably… he probably just thought it was better to have a powered side than to not have one.

[Samuel Choong] 18:47:05
Oh, awesome, Oscar.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:14
Yeah, we might need to.

[annalise] 18:47:15
I mean, we can… we can still reply, being like, sorry.

[Alex] 18:47:15
Hold on, I'll be back in, like, 2 minutes.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:21
Yeah, I can just… yeah, I mean, do…

[annalise] 18:47:21
for the late reply.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:26
Do we need anything else? What kind of equipment do they offer?

[annalise] 18:47:29
I think it's a safety thing, that's why they're asking, you know, they're saying what equipment will you be using?

[annalise] 18:47:34
They just want to know for us. I'm assuming it's probably safety or insurance.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:37
table, lowkey.

[annalise] 18:47:39
No, no, no, I think it's specific about powered site.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:42
Uh, to say, uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:45
Nair-powered equipment? Oh my god, I was always gonna be so lame, by the way, we're actually gonna have nothing.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:49
That's true.

[annalise] 18:47:50
Okay, wait. Okay, I can… I'll draft up an email now, right? Assuming let's just do it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:47:56
Oh, I was Michael, huh?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:56
You guys gotta make some, like…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:47:58
brochures or something to give out, like, low-key.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:01
Yeah, you can do that. You can do that, Raymond.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:03
Yeah, I'm very, like, shh.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:05
That's your job to do, mate.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:06
We did ask Yang.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:08
Well, Marci and Marco right now.

[annalise] 18:48:08
Yes, it's okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:09
Wait, but seriously, though? Like, what are we actually… what are you actually gonna do with this store?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:13
Like all the clubs? Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:14
beg people to join. For charging?!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:16
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:17
Wait, Mahu did request this sh-!

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:22
charging! I'm actually done, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:26
charging. He just went…

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:26
He said, he said, he said, he said charging for laptop or phone if we wanted to scroll.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:34
Oh my god, bro.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:37
We knew it buries, or we knew it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:39
Oh my god, this cost…

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:42
Sounds too good.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:42
No, you're right there, honestly.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:48:44
That's right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:49
Okay, wait, he said, I was thinking…

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:50
to have a laptop up.

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:54
Can we use a portable charger for a laptop? I'm sure you could, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:48:57
If they plug in.

[annalise] 18:48:57
Well, I mean, we already have a powered site, so unless they've taken it away, because we haven't messaged back, then…

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:02
Maybe we code.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:49:03
We already have it, it's still with secured.

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:06
Oh…

[annalise] 18:49:06
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:07
Okay, could you please provide details on what equipment you'll be using?

[annalise] 18:49:13
is just a laptop?

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:14
I would say, like, we'll have a table set up with, like, a laptop and a few chargers.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:49:19
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:19
a few charges, like, to use for the laptop, so that we can, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:23
show.

[annalise] 18:49:27
Okay, laptop…

[annalise] 18:49:37
I think we need to say what?

[annalise] 18:49:44
Do we know if we want one laptop, a few laptops?

[Samuel Choong] 18:49:48
Just say a few.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:49:56
Remember, Michael's your goofy burn. She can't.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:50:03
Sophony.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:50:08
I mean, you guys can print out, like, the QR codes for our socials and whatever, you know?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:50:16
Have we decided if we're charging for memberships?

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:19
I think we should, if we have no Loki, if we have no armsuma. Oh! Actually, no, even though we don't have Amsu, we still have FBE grants that we can apply for.

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:28
So we're not, like, completely broke.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:50:33
over… so if we… if we can't get OMC grant, it's actually so cool.

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:38
It is what it is. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:40
I feel like we should charge for maybe, like, 5 bucks, so…

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:44
Was that too much?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:50:46
It depends, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:47
Oh, okay. To be fair, if we charge, we need to give something to offer, though.

[annalise] 18:50:52
Yeah, people usually will pay because you have, like, a little free something. Well, free, like, I don't know, tote. But, I mean, we don't have brands.

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:54
Yeah…

[Samuel Choong] 18:50:59
Let me… Is Alex back yet?

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:05
Okay, what if we get that monster sponsorship?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:06
No.

[annalise] 18:51:06
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:11
And then, like, I don't know, we get a fun… like, we get free stuff.

[annalise] 18:51:11
Mmm. a month of our membership. Guys, like, that sticks.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:14
And then you… and then, like… and then, like, they sign up, and then we give them, like, free monsters.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:19
Type shit. Type shit.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:19
And then luckily, we might have to sign up for Red Bull 2, just for the love of the game.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:22
Like, we might just have to caffeine overdose, you know?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:25
Yeah, it is what it is. Solding vouchers as well, solving vouchers.

[annalise] 18:51:27
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:28
True, true. How are you going to reach out to Solving, bro?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:29
Come on now.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:32
I'm not gonna reach out to solving. Actually, that's true. What do they do? Did they look at just, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:37
But imagine we get, like, a Marcus sponsorship, that shit would be too funny.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:42
Vera, we're going broke, I'm not even joking.

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:45
Um…

[annalise] 18:51:45
Um, do we need question? Can we quickly, if you can quickly look at the email, I'll send it. Do we… do you want any more info?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:52
doing…

[Samuel Choong] 18:51:54
Nah. Or maybe ask… ask… how do we get the…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:51:58
constant charge.

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:00
Should we ask… should we ask them how to get tables, or is that… do you guys know how to get tables? I don't know how to get tables.

[annalise] 18:52:00
We need to…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:52:06
No, I have no clue.

[annalise] 18:52:08
Oh, um…

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:08
Okay, yeah, let me just ask, how do we get tables?

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:10
So, also, also, quick question, how do we get to the tables? Something like that.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:52:14
I saw the table should, like, already be there now, or am I tripping?

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:18
No, I agree, but I don't… you know, like, Loki, I don't know, you know? Like, you never know.

[annalise] 18:52:19
Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:52:21
Yeah, yeah.

[annalise] 18:52:23
is the provided. Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:34
Bro, I wish we'd partnered with, like, sneaker laundry or something. That should be so cool.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:52:38
I forgot what we did us!

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:40
I've actually been meaning to go, I need to get my shoes cleaned.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:52:44
Sneak over to me.

[annalise] 18:52:46
You know what? Maybe… maybe you should do that for the membership, just clean their shoes.

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:46
No, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:48
I have… I have the guy's personal phone number, Ben.

[annalise] 18:52:52
What I can say for every… everyone who signs up to BAS.

[annalise] 18:52:56
you personally will clean their shoes.

[Samuel Choong] 18:52:58
Shula, you just contact them and see if they want to do a partnership.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:01
Nah, nah, never mind. There's no fucking overlap between sneaker laundry and pass.

[annalise] 18:53:11
Okay, any last questions? All good to send? Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:12
talking…

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:13
No, no, I think Imo should be good.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:15
How good about that.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:26
Okay, I think email's sorted then, or is there any more emails?

[annalise] 18:53:30
Oh, there's an email that like just came in.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:34
Isn't it the one you just sent?

[annalise] 18:53:36
No, I record show your club has not completed all of the compulsory bystander intervention and responding disclosure training requirements.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:42
I don't know, we talked about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:43
Oh yeah, we talked, we talked about that already.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:45
Before you got here, yeah.

[annalise] 18:53:46
Oh, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:47
we're sending, we're sending out the environment in.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:49
Yeah, that's true.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:50
Do you guys wanna go tomorrow? Or do you guys… you guys have to go tomorrow, though.

[annalise] 18:53:51
Okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:54
Yeah, we do. We have to go tomorrow.

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:54
Because, you know…

[Samuel Choong] 18:53:56
You should, like, you book them, or, like, do the online module.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:53:59
But when you book? Oh, yeah, we do.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:00
I don't know. Oh, we also… have you guys finished the LMS?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:03
Oh, we do.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:05
If you guys finished the LMS training.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:06
Okay, I need to finish it. Uh…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:06
I finished that, I finished that.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:09
you're lacking.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:13
Man, if we're in a discord right now, I'd be saying something different, bro.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:18
Screw you, Emma. If this wasn't… if this wasn't recorded…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:20
What?

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:22
I was fair-flaming you right now. Uh, anyway…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:24
With what? What'd I do?

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:26
Just for the love of the game, bro. Is there anything else we need to talk about?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:27
Oh, okay.

[annalise] 18:54:30
Oh, wait, quick question. Did you guys all get that email that I sent, or no?

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:33
Yeah, I got it, no, I got it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:35
I got it. No, it's a good email.

[annalise] 18:54:35
I don't know, like, an error message, right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:38
Oh, what? I can see it.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:54:40
I got it, I got it.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:42
Bass at Univo.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:45
Um, I don't think there's anything else.

[Alex] 18:54:46
Sorry, guys, I'm back. Did I miss much?

[annalise] 18:54:46
Yes.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:48
Nah, I… we were thinking, though, Alex, what…

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:51
What is your opinion on, like, charging for memberships?

[Alex] 18:54:55
I reckon if we charge a small amount, there's no issue. Because, like, realistically, especially if we're not getting grants, because I couldn't even be terribly surprised if they decided they weren't going to give them to us.

[Samuel Choong] 18:54:58
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:01
Yeah.

[Alex] 18:55:06
We need funding from somewhere.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:07
Okay, sure. And is a membership even, like, good to have if they're not giving us their money? Like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:08
Hmm.

[annalise] 18:55:16
Well…

[Alex] 18:55:16
charge, like, 5 bucks, and it's Chill Haps or something, you know?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:19
benefit us if they're members of us.

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:21
If this is free.

[annalise] 18:55:21
Because it means that they're more likely… they're just going to be added to all of the emails that we're going to spam, so they're more likely to come to events.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:30
I mean, maybe. But look, he… like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:32
I don't think… I don't know. Yeah, I never check. I likely never check. Deadass.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:33
I'm signed up to a lot of those, and I never read those, yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:36
Yeah.

[annalise] 18:55:40
Also, yeah, we were saying, Alex, do you think it'd be possible to get the monster sponsor?

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:44
Do you think… yeah, do you think we can get a monster before a week?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:47
So we can give out monsters?

[Alex] 18:55:49
Uh, it was not very hard to get the Monster sponsorship. I sent one email, and he said yes.

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:49
I… I…

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:50
of the soul?

[Samuel Choong] 18:55:54
Okay, so that's about it. Just do that. I'll talk to Therese as well.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:55:55
How can that show that, or how can you just do that?

[Alex] 18:55:57
I can't send the email, though, because I was… I got in contact from BAP, so COI, can someone else do it?

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:02
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can send it, I can send it all, um, Tweeza can send it, don't worry.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:08
Can you let you send me the email you sent to him? Just so I know what to let you say?

[Raymond Jiang] 18:56:09
I should.

[Alex] 18:56:12
Yeah, I'll send it through right now.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:16
Okay, if not…

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:18
Um, oh, we need plant compounding, guys.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:21
Let's pick a date.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:24
And combining, and we need to figure out

[Raymond Jiang] 18:56:24
Yeah…

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:26
what Annalise said before, who's actually going to Summerfest?

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:30
Because you can have as many… okay, like, realistically, you have a bunch of people there if you really want.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:34
I don't think they're gonna be, like,

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:37
standing there at Sath Lawn and being like, yo…

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:40
You guys have 6 people instead of 5. Like, one of us ago.

[annalise] 18:56:43
They weren't. People can just, like, walk around and let people have breaks and stuff.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:44
Yeah… Okay, let's do Summerfest.

[Raymond Jiang] 18:56:45
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:47
How do we want to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:50
How do an organizers who's going to what? Do we just wanna…

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:53
have, like, at least one.

[Samuel Choong] 18:56:56
How do you want to organize who's going? She was just asking.

[annalise] 18:56:58
Okay, well, we should 1st pull up who's let's get that poll.

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:10
FAST committee.

[annalise] 18:57:11
Yep, so that 8, yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:12
I… aight.

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:14
Wait, let's note it down. It's…

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:17
Grace, Elliot.

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:22
These are…

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:32
That's calm. Mmm…

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:36
Wait, Alex, will you be at ours, or will you be at Babs as well?

[Alex] 18:57:40
I'll probably be floating between the two of them, but I might lean more towards the Bass one.

[Alex] 18:57:46
like, R1, um, I've got the email now, I'll send it in the Messenger chat.

[Alex] 18:57:51
Give me one sec.

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:51
Yeah, because, like, I know Elliot and Ali are also in their own clubs, and I can…

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:56
As in, if it's, like, a thing where…

[Samuel Choong] 18:57:58
We need to cut down on people.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:01
You can just have grace, Theresa, Lufe, Alex, and Anna, like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:05
and Annalise, and then I'll be in my 180 store.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:08
Ali and Ellie will be at an Addison B1.

[Alex] 18:58:11
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:11
You know, so it's like…

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:13
Yeah, like, they can, like, realistically…

[annalise] 18:58:13
Just get everyone to come.

[Alex] 18:58:14
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:16
out of the people that can come, it's fine for them all to come, because I don't think we need to cut down on anyone, because

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:21
there'll be other stalls. Like, as we had a different stall as well.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:25
you know, so people will be at different stores,

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:28
hanging out with different people, right?

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:30
So, what was the max for Summerfest?

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:33
Five. Two…

[annalise] 18:58:34
2. Yeah, from memory, but I'll have a look again.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:35
What? No way is too… wait, is Summerfest in South Lawn or whatever?

[Alex] 18:58:43
Uh, I can't remember.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:44
Not Southampton, where is it? Uh, Google Maps. Like, that, that big-ass green oval in front of FBE?

[annalise] 18:58:48
Yeah, that that is so… that's helpful.

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:49
Okay, all my whole life when I went last year, there was not two people from each club, bro.

[Alex] 18:58:54
What the hell?

[Samuel Choong] 18:58:57
But, is Lincoln Square, right? No, Uni Square. There was not two…

[annalise] 18:59:01
What are you doing? What are these questions? This is… is this the… Oh, is that the bystander training?

[Alex] 18:59:02
Raymond, what the hell are these questions?

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:06
What the heck?

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:11
Yeah, yeah, not… Very well.

[Alex] 18:59:13
Hmm? Someone… keep in mind, someone is getting paid by the uni to sit down and write these fucking questions. Like, what are we doing?

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:20
But what are we doing, man? Why are we… why do we even have a commerce degree if they can… if we can do this way?

[Alex] 18:59:20
It's ridiculous.

[annalise] 18:59:22
I heard this graduation.

[annalise] 18:59:26
Wait, oh, there's only one right answer.

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:29
I mean, I don't want to see this shit anymore. Stop the screen share, bro, we need to…

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:35
When you block it. Um…

[annalise] 18:59:39
Um, it says… oh, no, no, no, it says 11am to 3 p.m. In Market Hall and surrounds.

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:39
Only two people…

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:45
Okay, I think I know where Marco Hall is.

[Alex] 18:59:45
I don't know where Market Hall is, I can't lie.

[annalise] 18:59:48
Isn't that next to… that's, like, near the alts?

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:50
Yeah…

[Alex] 18:59:51
Building 189.

[annalise] 18:59:54
All right.

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:54
It's… it's… it's NEO, it's Student Path.

[Alex] 18:59:54
Don't know why that is.

[Alex] 18:59:58
Ah, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 18:59:59
It's where… it's where Zion Barrows is, if you guys know where that is.

[annalise] 19:00:01
Good. Hmm.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:04
Why, why are we not in uni…

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:06
Uni Square.

[annalise] 19:00:08
Maybe that's for the Tuesday and Monday Tuesday.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:15
That's cheap, so whatever. Do we have to sign up for, or do we just walk up?

[annalise] 19:00:20
For one.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:21
for Summerfest. I know we already signed up, but do we have to tell them who's going?

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:25
But, okay.

[annalise] 19:00:26
Well, Michael filled in the survey. That's what I think. I don't… it was in the… it was in the survey, I think it said…

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:28
If we don't have the title of who's going, then we can just lock up.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:31
You know? I… it's okay.

[Alex] 19:00:32
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:33
I think…

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:36
I think SummerFest is done then, don't worry about that. We'll create a group chat.

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:40
With the…

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:45
Well, credit reach out later on. Uh, okay, what's after Summerfest?

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:50
Like, what else are we supposed to talk about?

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:52
I like he forgot.

[Alex] 19:00:54
Guys, by the way, I might have to run off in a sec, um, just letting you know, so…

[Samuel Choong] 19:00:57
Okay. Oh, this… wait, is there anything else we need to talk about? Oh, come bonding, guys.

[annalise] 19:01:02
Mm-hmm. Is that with just Austin, the directors, or also are gonna be… Chill.

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:02
Calm bonding. What do we want to do?

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:07
No, just ask some directors, ask them directors.

[annalise] 19:01:13
Well, are we doing, like, this in person, right?

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Alex] 19:01:16
Yeah.

[annalise] 19:01:18
Um, well, I mean, didn't we all agree on that one meeting time anyways?

[annalise] 19:01:23
that everyone said they were free for. Otherwise we should do on the weekend, probably, right?

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:33
like, what, under 20th?

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:36
Uh, on the…

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:38
Wait, what dates are we doing it from?

[annalise] 19:01:43
Is this all, like, weekly meetings or monthly? I don't know how often you wanted to have them.

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:51
No, this is not our weekly… this is not our weekly meetings.

[annalise] 19:01:54
I mean, because it… everyone said that they were available Tuesday, 5.30.

[Samuel Choong] 19:01:59
No, no, no, that's, like, comp meetings. That's, like, the whole committee comes to meet. This is like a…

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:05
the bonding that we're gonna have before uni starts.

[annalise] 19:02:08
Yeah, but I mean, as in for a time, if that worked for everyone, it could possibly still work.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:13
But I think Tuesday only works, because that's the uni time. Like, that's our uni schedules.

[annalise] 19:02:19
Mm, fair.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:19
But, like, we're in, like, holiday period now.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:21
So, I think we'd probably have to pick a different day, that's not… I mean, we can try Tuesday.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:26
But…

[annalise] 19:02:27
Do we just want to give a day? And then whoever comes can come.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:31
I think we want to try to have a time that everyone can come.

[annalise] 19:02:40
Um, so if we want… Raymond here, then our choices.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:45
It's before the 20th.

[annalise] 19:02:48
Okay.

[Samuel Choong] 19:02:48
So, like, next time, next week, next week, I think.

[annalise] 19:02:55
Or why not 15th? A Sunday? A weekend?

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:02
Yeah, we can try… I have…

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:04
Only issues.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:06
I have two meetings on the 15th with…

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:09
spawns and projects.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:12
3PM and 6PM.

[annalise] 19:03:12
What time? I mean, which one's 3pm? Is that with the… Wait, but you're gonna see them in person, so you can just have those meetings in person.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:18
Those projects.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:25
Uh, but it's not the same, because I need my… because Michael's supposed to be in the meeting, too.

[annalise] 19:03:29
Right. Wait, where's Michael?

[Alex] 19:03:32
work.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:32
He's in China by his way.

[Alex] 19:03:34
He's… he's at a J sla.

[annalise] 19:03:34
Oh, when… When's he back?

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:39
Uh… like…

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:41
in time for… no.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:43
26th of Feb, I think.

[annalise] 19:03:45
Ah, okay, right.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:49
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:50
Okay, how about we pick a day that we're all free, and then we'll see what time the directors… okay, I don't mind Sunday, we can try Sunday.

[Samuel Choong] 19:03:57
Or even Monday or Tuesday, like, which…

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:01
Or do we want to pick an event that we want to do first?

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:04
And then figure out the day after.

[annalise] 19:04:09
what event… I feel like we should do something centered around a time. I feel like a whole day is a bit too ambitious. We either have something during the day or something at night.

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:17
Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Um… I don't know.

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:20
Any ideas? Raymond, Alex, any ideas of what you guys…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:04:22
I used to do bouldering, we should do bouldering. We should do bouldering.

[Alex] 19:04:23
Yeah, I think bouldering would be loved by Shauna.

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:26
Okay, we can do bouldering.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:04:28
I also have, like, I Loki have, like, two more free weeks of bouldering that I haven't claimed yet, so…

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:33
Nice. Okay, we'll do bolding. What day do you guys want to do bouldering?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:04:37
I can do any day. Before, like, before I leave, so…

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:40
I think I can do it any day as well.

[Alex] 19:04:43
Uh, I could… are you talking about, like, next week, yeah?

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:44
Yeah, next week.

[Alex] 19:04:47
Um, I think at this stage, I'm pretty flexible as well. Let me double check.

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:51
Annalise, do you have work?

[annalise] 19:04:54
I can… no, it's because I… yeah, I'm getting a surgery next week, so I don't think my… No, it's just for… it's like, it's my piercing. I had… it got, like, infected, so now they have to…

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:54
on…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:04:58
Oh, what? What… what surgery, can I ask?

[Samuel Choong] 19:04:59
Oh…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:05:06
Oh, yikes.

[annalise] 19:05:07
Yeah, so I don't think my doctor will be happy. Me on antibiotics.

[annalise] 19:05:13
I'd have to ask TJ going bouldering. Monday. So that's why I'm already… I mean, I'm already not… like, there's no chance I'll be going to work on Tuesday anyways, so I could come and watch.

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:15
What day is your surgery?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:05:16
Done.

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:22
I mean…

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:24
I mean, you can come up, because I'm gonna come and watch, I can't go bouldering either. I'm just gonna come and chill.

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:29
So…

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:31
I don't know, I'll see.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:05:32
Wait, what the f- what the fuck, I need a full mock this quiz.

[annalise] 19:05:33
So…

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:37
Okay, man, you're a bumper. Uh…

[annalise] 19:05:39
Are you really gonna… are you gonna chat GPT sexual harassment?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:05:41
already did, and I still got it… still…

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:44
No, man, you're like, oh man.

[annalise] 19:05:45
Um, but anyways, I'm, like, weekends, 14th, 15th. Or then I guess… that hopefully that Tuesday, hopefully.

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:56
I don't mind. If you ask me to do Sunday, we can.

[Samuel Choong] 19:05:58
It's… what do you guys think?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:02
Yeah, I mean, like I said, I can do any day, so…

[Samuel Choong] 19:06:04
You can do any day? Okay. What about Andy? Can Andy?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:05
Am I?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:10
Should probably ask him.

[Samuel Choong] 19:06:11
Okay, and then what time do you guys want to do it?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:12
Which says, what are you thinking again?

[Samuel Choong] 19:06:15
I will… hopefully before Annalisa surgery, which is on Monday.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:19
Sir…

[annalise] 19:06:20
So I I said 14 for 15th Saturday, Sunday.

[Samuel Choong] 19:06:23
I think 15… I'm free on 15th.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:23
14th or 15. Okay. Yeah, okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:27
Alex.

[Alex] 19:06:28
Yeah, that's fine for me. Uh…

[Alex] 19:06:30
I might have an exam on the 15th.

[Alex] 19:06:32
Long story, I was meant to go to Sydney for it, like, the finance thing I do there.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:37
ShikiLad?

[Alex] 19:06:37
But flights are, like, 600 return for a 90-minute exam, so I messaged saying I have some… a family thing, can I do the exam online?

[Alex] 19:06:45
If he says yes, then it'll be fine, and I'm free after, like, 11am.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:06:48
not gonna let you do the exam online, bro, let's be real.

[Alex] 19:06:52
Uh, it's not… it's not as deep as, like, a uni exam, though.

[Alex] 19:06:56
So… I would just wait and see what he says.

[Samuel Choong] 19:06:59
We'll do 15 for now, and then we can play by ear. We can change it.

[Alex] 19:07:01
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:02
As it goes. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:05
Do you want to do, like, afternoon?

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:07
morning slash afternoon.

[Alex] 19:07:07
Yeah, afternoon would be good, because then it's pretty, um…

[Alex] 19:07:10
like, I should be fine no matter what.

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:12
Okay, afternoon, like…

[annalise] 19:07:13
also a place bouldering, but where?

[Alex] 19:07:15
urban climb. Is that what it's called?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:18
urban climb, urban climb.

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:18
Where's urban clan?

[annalise] 19:07:20
Where's urban climb?

[Alex] 19:07:21
Collingwood, or, like, Southeast, I forgot what's in Southeast?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:22
This… there's true.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:26
Blackburn… I think Collingwood is…

[Alex] 19:07:27
Uh, aced, not south-eaced.

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:27
What is everyone like?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:28
That's… yeah, that's not Southeast, but it's the one you were talking about.

[Alex] 19:07:31
Collingwood ones are the southeast…

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:31
Oh, Blackburn…

[annalise] 19:07:32
Really got us going to Collingwood. Oh, good.

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:35
Where do you guys live? I know…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:36
Lingu's not too bad.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:38
Well, most people, right?

[Alex] 19:07:39
Yeah, the Collingwood one I've been to a fair few times. Just check the weather.

[Alex] 19:07:41
Neither of them have AC if Sunday's hot.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:42
Outside Alex, outside the gates, outside the gates.

[annalise] 19:07:42
I didn't even get…

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:47
The weather's pretty hot on Sunday.

[Alex] 19:07:49
Yeah, they don't have AC, so…

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:51
Right, you can even go to the beach on Sunday if you really wanted.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:52
Wait. Wait, is Andy back?

[Samuel Choong] 19:07:56
We're gonna be from the coal?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:07:59
No, because he's, like, not muted anymore, so I thought…

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:02
I think he just left us, I don't know. Okay, we'll do Sunday, maybe what?

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:06
Do you want to do early afternoon, or late afternoon?

[Raymond Jiang] 19:08:11
I'm reminding you.

[annalise] 19:08:13
before or after lunch, or at lunch. I think that's, like…

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:17
You'd do, like, before, and then we can get lunch.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:08:19
Are we trying to get lunch together, or is that, like, too big?

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get lunch together.

[annalise] 19:08:23
I think that'll be easy.

[Alex] 19:08:23
If it's in Collingwood, there's a cool place nearby, the, like, train on top of a building, Eazy's.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:08:27
Yeah, Alex knows all the places, so…

[annalise] 19:08:28
Oh, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:30
Okay, I do, like, morning-ish, like, say…

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:32
maybe 11am?

[annalise] 19:08:34
is… is Collingwood like your spot? Is that why?

[annalise] 19:08:38
know all these places, or… I didn't really think there was much in Collingwood.

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:45
I don't know. Wait, Annalisa, where do you live?

[annalise] 19:08:48
I'm southeast. It's I'm like, I don't know if you know. I'm in McKinney, which is, like, near… near Bentley, like, 10 minutes from Brighton. It's close to Bay, like Bayside.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:08:52
How far south is?

[Samuel Choong] 19:08:59
Oh, I see.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:01
I don't mind. Calling was fine, then. 11, okay.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:02
I think it's alright.

[annalise] 19:09:05
Nice. It's really, like, it's only, like, an hour transport.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:08
A lot of them are, like, um, like…

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:10
Good.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:10
international and interstate, so they'll be, like, in the city area as well, so…

[Alex] 19:09:13
Collingwood's close to inner city, then, arguably… correct me if I'm wrong, but Collingwood's easier to get to than Blackburn from the city. I don't know that.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:13
Okay, we can…

[annalise] 19:09:14
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:15
We can do 11…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:16
No, it literally is.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:20
Is it? You can just take the… you can take the…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:20
Yeah, I reckon so.

[annalise] 19:09:22
It's just trying to parliament, all right? Parliament then tram? Bus?

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:25
You can… yeah, possibly.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:27
Okay, at Collingwood, 11am.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:30
And then we can get lunch after?

[annalise] 19:09:32
Um…

[Alex] 19:09:32
Yeah, that should be fine. I'll let you know probably within the next day or two if I'm fine to go.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:36
Yeah.

[Alex] 19:09:37
Either way, I'd probably be late, because if he agrees…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:37
That's true, then.

[Alex] 19:09:40
The exam would finish at, like,

[Alex] 19:09:42
10.30 to 11.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:43
Yeah, it's calm.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:44
Yeah, it's a classic, really.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:45
Um, Alex, what is the lunch place that you're thinking of?

[Alex] 19:09:48
It's called AZs.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:48
I haven't know about it. Can you…

[annalise] 19:09:48
not want to do in them, so you have enough time.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:50
But not be too bougie.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:51
Can you ride it?

[Alex] 19:09:51
No, it's not. It's a train on top of a building.

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:54
Nice. Can you write it in the chat, and then…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:09:55
Wait, what? That's a… that's a thing?

[Samuel Choong] 19:09:57
Can you write it in the… not the chart, in the doc?

[annalise] 19:09:59
I've seen on TikTok, it's a burger place, right?

[Alex] 19:10:01
I send it in Messenger, I type it in Zoom, I didn't know which one you…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:10:03
Ooh, I like… I like burgers. I like burgers.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:04
Okay, Messenger.

[annalise] 19:10:04
Oh.

[Alex] 19:10:06
Yeah, you're on top of school.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:06
Easyz.

[annalise] 19:10:08
So, do you want to do, like, 12-1, so then you have enough time, if you have an exam?

[Alex] 19:10:12
Oh, I don't mind, I can just rock up a little late.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:24
Easies, okay.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:26
Do they allow bookings?

[Alex] 19:10:29
Right there, yeah.

[Alex] 19:10:31
Okay, guys, so I'm so sorry, I might have to run off now, but…

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:34
Yeah, that's calm. Oh, Alex, can you send me the… did you… can you send me the actual email of what you said to the Monster Guy as well?

[Alex] 19:10:36
Um…

[Alex] 19:10:40
Oh, I put it in the exec chat. Oh, what I wrote to him. Yeah, I can do that.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:42
Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's calm.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:45
Uh, we'll just send a message into the bass chat, then, about…

[annalise] 19:10:49
Do you want to carry this on to I'll send a screenshot to Lufei. What? I don't know what to do with her.

[annalise] 19:10:56
I'll tell her to make a new Messenger account, but if it's… It wasn't working before.

[Samuel Choong] 19:10:59
You can try to make a new Messenger account, or maybe see if there's anything with her email or phone number.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:05
I don't know why… Oh, worst comes to worst, you just create a messenger group chat.

[annalise] 19:11:07
I don't know. Yeah, probably no, because she can be in group chats, so why does that…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:09
So you don't have to use it? Yeah.

[Alex] 19:11:12
bit of a long email.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:11:13
Yeah, she just doesn't have the feature. It could be that it just wasn't distributed to her account.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:13
Yeah, just make a messenger group chat.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:16
Does she… wait, has she updated her Messenger on the app store?

[annalise] 19:11:19
Yeah, she deleted it, and then re-downloaded it, so it had to be up to the newest.

[Alex] 19:11:25
Alright, I chucked what I wrote to Tyler in the chat.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:25
Um…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:28
Okay, easy. I'll get that email done, then.

[Alex] 19:11:31
Yeah. Um…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:33
Um…

[Alex] 19:11:34
I'll duck off now, if you guys need anything else from me, just let me know.

[Alex] 19:11:39
like, I'll be on Messenger and stuff like that.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:40
Yeah, Scott. Alright, see Alex.

[Alex] 19:11:42
Alright, thanks guys. I'll see you later.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:43
So…

[Raymond Jiang] 19:11:44
Bye, bye.

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:46
Uh, I don't think there's much…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:49
much for us to do. We've done all the…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:52
portfolio. I'll…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:54
If you do Sunday, maybe that's when the…

[Samuel Choong] 19:11:57
When spawns and the, uh, marketing team can also talk, which should be chill.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:02
Um… I can do anatomy after that. I don't think there's much else to discuss.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:07
But do you guys have anything else you want to talk about?

[annalise] 19:12:09
No, I should just put that in the chat for that day and ask if people are available because some might not be in the morning or night, vice versa.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:18
Yeah, yeah, we'll just have to see.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:20
Yeah, we'll see, hopefully they are available, yeah.

[annalise] 19:12:23
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:24
I get… if not, I think we can, like, finish up… wrap up the meeting then.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:12:29
Need full control and expressions of anger? That's the answer.

[annalise] 19:12:33
Oh, last question. Do you want me to get on anything for events?

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:33
Nice.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:39
Uh, I'll just have a meeting now. Like, have a meeting earlier than later, I think.

[annalise] 19:12:44
Because I lost… I mean, our last meeting, what we really said is we were just waiting to see what sponsors we can get, especially because we were thinking of the Career Expo or Q&A panel.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:45
just have a meeting.

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:50
Yeah. I think…

[Samuel Choong] 19:12:53
have… okay, have a career expo first. Can you… are you able to create a timeline with Lufei and Mei about the events?

[annalise] 19:13:00
Yeah, easy. Do you all… I'm just gonna make a group chat on Instagram. Do you guys wanna be in it? Or who wants to? Or I'll just communicate everything.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:00
And then… s…

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:05
Uh, perfectly, preferably make it on Messenger if you can.

[annalise] 19:13:09
Oh, wait.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:11
No, I don't need to be in a group chat. You shouldn't just be in it. You can just communicate to us, but…

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:15
create, like, a… try create, like, a solidified timeline.

[annalise] 19:13:16
Yes.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:19
or just solidify which events you're gonna run.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:22
And… just communicate which events you guys have chosen.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:26
And then we'll talk about that a bit more after.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:30
And then, yeah. But try to have some meetings now, all of you guys.

[annalise] 19:13:31
No, it's true.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:35
Raymond, Andy, I don't know if Andy can hear me. I'll tell this to Alex too, but, like, try to have your meetings with your directors earlier than later.

[annalise] 19:13:35
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:42
Because we just gotta set everything up, we don't want to be falling behind.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:13:42
Yeah.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:13:46
Yeah.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:47
Okay, if not, I think we can wrap this meeting up, guys.

[Raymond Jiang] 19:13:52
Alright, chill.

[annalise] 19:13:53
Again, jump. I see ya. Bye-bye.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:54
Alright, so you guys skipping.

[Samuel Choong] 19:13:55
See you guys soon. Bye.
